This is clearly a political attack, as she has long supported the coal industry and the associated jobs.  However, she is correct in that the coal industry is not what it once was, and her attempt to eliminate it entirely would result in more severe job losses in the region.  As of now, she is the Democratic candidate for president, and the republican candidate, Donald Trump, has expressed similar views on the coal industry, so it is likely that the coal industry will continue to decline under either candidate.\"\n"

      "3425 & president donald trump is still looking for a new fbi director more than three weeks after he fired james comey and sources familiar with the recruiting process say it has been chaotic and that job interviews led by trump have been brief. three close associates of three contenders for the job all of whom have been interviewed by trump said the candidates were summoned to the white house for 10 to 20 minute conversations with trump vice president mike pence and attorney general jeff sessions. those conversations which followed initial interviews at the justice department have been light on questions about substantive issues facing the agency the three associates said. while the department has compiled a long list of candidates for the white house there has been no clear framework or logic for who was interviewed and why said one of the sources. another of the three sources described the process as chaotic and said that in one interview trump spoke mostly about himself and seemed distracted. the white house declined to comment on the nature of the interview process. spokesman sean spicer said on friday that trump continues to meet with candidates but would not give a timeline for choosing a nominee. on may 18 trump told reporters he was very close to sending a nomination for a new director of the federal bureau of investigation to the senate. at the time former senator joe lieberman was a front runner for the post. he withdrew his name from consideration on may 25. at least a dozen other people have been under consideration according to a white house spokeswoman but not all have been interviewed by trump. republican representative trey gowdy was under consideration but he said on may 15 he was not interested. the next day republican senator john cornyn also a contender said he would stay in the senate. spicer said on tuesday that trump planned to meet that afternoon with john pistole a former deputy director of the fbi and head of the transportation security administration and chris wray former head of the justice departments criminal division. the white house has said trump also interviewed lieberman former oklahoma governor frank keating acting fbi director andrew mccabe and former fbi official richard mcfeely. trump reportedly told russian officials during a visit to the white house on may 10 that firing comey the previous day relieved great pressure the president was feeling from an investigation of possible ties between his election campaign team and russian officials. the new york times first reported that in his remarks to the russians trump called comey crazy a real nut job. trump has denied any collusion between russia and his presidential campaign. he has repeatedly questioned the united states intelligence finding that russian president vladimir putin directed an operation intended to swing the election in trumps favor against democratic rival hillary clinton. russia has repeatedly denied any effort to interfere in the united states election but putin said on thursday some russians might have acted on their own without their governments involvement. comey is set to testify on thursday

because the group was one they didn t like in a state for which they didn t care with a better result than paris because of well guns?and where has the federal governments response been to an isis claimed attack on american soil? president obama hasn t even mentioned it. the press secretary made a fairly perfunctory comment about violence not being the proper response to expression even if offensive. one might have thought he was speaking of a video rather than an islamist terror attack on the united states. again no mention of isis islamists or terrorism. meanwhile the president has managed to go on letterman to golf and to attend democratic. the words of mister goldberg who gets to define what is provocative?i don t know if i would agree with everything mister goldberg writes but i would defend his right to say it even if he were provocative. vox calls the garland event hate speech. i think much of what vox says is hate speech. who gets to decide? i have multiple options to object to the content by protest and by pen that is the benefit of being an american. as mister goldberg notes iran has a holocaust cartoon contest every year basically catering to holocaust deniers. are they attacked? no they are laughed at they are. we are all in or we are not. either we believe in what we say we do or we do not. but if we do not if we allow offense or political difference to limit that protected speech if we start to suggest as some of these writers do what speech should or should not be allowed we move down the slippery slope to the rule of the mob to the rule of the despot. in an ever growing media state where already even the slightest offense is often seized on and may result in the prevailing view hounding a person from his/her job for differing this is a frightening thought. & it was often offensive and frequently unfunny with attacks on religion and it didn t limit its criticism to islam actually attacking christianity more\", even discusses whether charges should be brought against the organizers of the garland\", the group was one they didn t like in a state for which they didn t care with a better result than paris because of well guns?and where has the federal governments response been to an isis claimed attack on american soil\", meanwhile the president has managed to go on letterman to golf and to attend democratic\", i have multiple options to object to the content by protestis the benefit of being an american\" & sooo when terrorists attack je suis charlie a french newspaper and kills innocent people working for the publication the world stands tall in support of free speech., when an american hosts a draw muhammed contest in texas and two terrorists are killed just before their plot to kill innocent americans exercising their free speech rights the organizer and attendants are criticized for inciting and even inviting violence., truth to tell in the story of charlie hebdo many left out that the cartoon magazine was something that we might call a liberal rag., yet even though i was none of those things i was charlie., but precisely because i didn t. because even the provocative offensive speech by assholes to paraphrase jeffrey goldberg of the atlantic is protected., especially the provocative speech the minority speech that which offends that which many may not like., because the government doesn t have the right to shut down offensive speech for being offensive and neither do terrorists with ak 47s., you do not have the right to kill over a. of the world seemed to agree leaders linking arms in paris being charlie., where are the crowds of media condemning the attack on free speech ?, where are the crowds of media highlighting even just the fact that this was immediately apparent isis endorsed attack on the united states?watch fox news martha maccallum attack event organizer pamela gellar for organizing an event that may have been controversial what we have is some like ny times reporter rukmini callamachi and even mcclatchy news in scary fashion asking when is provocative speech too much and attacking the people who held the event in garland more than calling out the., the press secretary made a fairly perfunctory comment about violence not being the proper response to expression even if offensive., one might have thought he was speaking of a video rather than an islamist terror attack on the united states., the words of mister goldberg who gets to define what is provocative?i don t know if i would agree with everything mister goldberg writes but i would defend his right to say it even if he were provocative., vox calls the garland event hate speech., i think much of what vox says is hate speech., we are all in or we are not., either we believe in what we say we do or we do not., but if we do not if we allow offense or political difference to limit that protected speech if we start to suggest as some of these writers do what speech should or should not be allowed we move down the slippery slope to the rule of the mob to the rule of the despot. & \"First of all i would like to say that the media does not have a lock on hypocrisy. in fact in this case the media is not hypocritical. what the media fails to mention is that the attack on free speech in texas was in response to two terrorists who were planning to kill innocent americans for their freedom of speech. and this is where the hypocrisy comes in. because not only did the terrorists have the right to kill the americans for their freedom of speech but the americans who criticized the organizers of the contest and the drawing of the muhammad image also had the right to kill those americans for their freedom of speech. but we do not hear this because the terrorists attack on free speech was on a news channel that is funded by advertisers who pay the news channel for the air time to broadcast their commercials. so you see this is a case of capitalism at work. which is ironic considering the source.\", \"I think that this is a very good example of a poorly written argument.

      "8708 & merrick garland hit an unwanted milestone on tuesday as the federal appeals court judges nomination to the united states supreme court reached its 125th day with no senate action tying for the longest pending nomination ever to the high court. in a move with little precedent in american history the republicans who control the senate have simply refused to take any action on president barack obamas nomination of garland 63 for a lifetime job on the nations top court. having been nominated on march 16 to replace conservative justice antonin scalia who died on february 13 garland chief judge of the federal appeals court in washington has now matched louis brandeis for the longest time between nomination and senate action. in 1916 the senate voted to confirm brandeis making him americas first jewish justice. the united states constitution assigns the senate the power to confirm the presidents nominations to the supreme court. the senates inaction on garland has made the court vacancy a key political prize in a presidential election year. republicans hopeful of winning back the white house from the democrats in the november 8 election insist that obamas successor name scalias replacement who could not have a lasting effect on the ideological balance of a court now split with four liberals and four conservatives. obama has appointed two of the current justices liberals elena kagan and sonia sotomayor. the white house and its allies made another push on tuesday to highlight republican intransigence. now despite chief judge garlands extraordinary qualifications republicans in the senate have refused to do their job and chief judge garlands nomination has now been pending longer than any supreme court nominee in history whos nomination was not otherwise withdrawn white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters. despite his outstanding record and qualifications republicans have obstructed judge garlands nomination in a way faced by no other supreme court nominee in our nations history added senate democratic leader harry reid. the senate is on recess until september. for the rival presidential hopefuls republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton the supreme court vacancy is both a political problem and an opportunity. in addition to scalias replacement the next president conceivably could not nominate as many as three more justices. three of the courts current eight members already are over age 77. that means obamas successor could not influence the courts ideological direction for decades. some conservatives view trump with suspicion. but the wealthy new york real estate developer has already floated names of conservative potential nominees in a bid to mollify some on the right. garland has established a reputation as a centrist in 19 years as an appellate judge. some liberal democrats have said clinton if elected could not put forth a nominee more liberal than garland so republicans would be smart to

The author notes that no other supreme court nominee in history has been held up for this long, and that the nomination is \"now pending longer than any supreme court nominee in history.\" The author also argues that the next president could not nominate as many as three more justices, because the next president would only be able to nominate one replacement for the late Antonin Scalia.\", \"The author argues that the republican majority in the senate should vote to confirm Garland to the supreme court because there is no better time than the present to ensure a conservative appointed to the court to serve for the next several decades.

      "406 & donald trump won in all five republican presidential primaries held on tuesday a clean sweep that illustrated his dominance along the eastern seaboard and prompted the real estate mogul to declare himself the presumptive nominee. in the democratic race former secretary of state hillary clinton won four of the five states in play on tuesday connecticut delaware maryland and pennsylvania. senator bernie sanders won the primary in rhode island. in both parties those results extended the front runners advantage in convention delegates. clinton appeared to have added 170 delegates to her lead over sanders by the associated presss count clinton now has 88 percent of the delegates she needs to clinch the democratic nomination. in the republican party trump exceeded the already high expectations for tuesday. as of 10 55 p.m. the ap projected that trump won at least 105 delegates compared with just five for ohio gov. john kasich and one for senator ted cruz. but the importance of tuesdays wins went beyond those numbers. for both clinton and trump they showed that a long drawn out primary fight might be close to an end and that stubborn adversaries seemed to be running out of time. clinton speaking to supporters in philadelphia was not very subtly looking beyond the primary attacking trump and making a pitch to democrats to unite behind her. whether you support senator sanders or you support me there is much more that unites us than divides us clinton said. she later talked about creating an america where love trumps hate. the crowd cheered at the pun and a bumper sticker with the slogan was already on sale for 5 dollars at clintons website. in the republican race trump appeared to be trouncing his rivals by huge margins winning by 30 percentage points or more in the first returns. wins on that scale will make it harder for cruz and kasich to argue that trump is a weak and divisive front runner. neither of trumps rivals can possibly clinch the nomination before the republican party convention in cleveland this summer. both men are now relying on long shot strategies which imagine that trump can also be stopped from reaching a majority of republican delegates and that the partys convention will bypass the leader and choose one them instead. this is a lot bigger win than we would have expected. and not only is it all five trump said at a news conference at trump tower in new york. he noted that he had passed 60 percent in results from several states. when you crack 60 with three people thats very hard to do. thats called a massive landslide. i consider myself the presumptive nominee absolutely. honestly senator cruz and gov. kasich should really get out of the race. they have no path to victory at all. we should heal the republican party bring the republican party together. and i m a unifier. trump said he will be going to indiana on wednesday where the may 3 primary is shaping up as the last best chance for trumps rivals to stop him. to help derail trump kasich agreed this week to not campaign in indiana allowing cruz to focus on the front runner. trump had spent several weeks complaining that the gops delegate system was rigged against him. on tuesday however trump was more ebullient. the best way to beat the system is to have evenings like this trump said. he likened himself to a boxer winning by knockout when the boxer knocks out the other boxer you don t have to wait around for a decision. trump also tried to pivot toward a general election although his attack on clinton seemed more improvised that clintons bumper sticker ready attack on him. if hillary clinton were a man i don t think she would get 5 percent of the vote he said. even before the polls closed tuesday night cruz was conceding the expected losses however he showed no indication of withdrawing from the race. tonight donald trump is expected to have a good night he said speaking to supporters in knightstown ind. in the gym where the movie hoosiers was filmed. but then cruz said that the race would turn his way in states such as indiana tonight this campaign moves back to more favorable terrain. kasich was running second in several of tuesdays primaries but it was a distant second hardly an affirmation of the theory that the governor would compete well with trump among the more moderate republicans of the east. it seemed likely that even after tuesdays results were tallied kasich would still not have as many delegates as senator marco rubio. rubio dropped out of the presidential race more than a month ago. in campaign parlance kasich was down on tuesday night; he was back in ohio and did not make a public statement or speech. for clinton tuesdays victories in large urban states reinforced her case against sanders that he has not broadened his coalition much beyond white liberals and that he struggles to win urban areas and populous states. sanders however showed no signs of giving up. the senator from vermont appeared shortly after 8 p.m. to boisterous cheers in an arena in huntington w.va. choosing to hold an election night rally in a state that holds its primary in two weeks. this campaign is not just about electing a president. it is about transforming our nation sanders said at the outset of his remarks to a crowd of about 6 400. it is about having the courage to demand a political revolution and you are the revolutionaries. delreal in philadelphia katie zezima in washington abby phillip in hammond ind. david weigel in mckees rocks pa. hernández in fort washington md. sean sullivan in indianapolis katherine shaver in bethesda md. josh hicks in annapolis john wagner in west virginia and rachel weiner and ed o keefe in washington contributed to this report. & scale will make it harder for cruztrump is a weak and divisive front runner\", they have no path to victory at all\" & donald trump won in all five republican presidential primaries held on tuesday a clean sweep that illustrated his dominance along the eastern seaboard and prompted the real estate mogul to declare himself the presumptive nominee., in the democratic race former secretary of state hillary clinton won four of the five states in play on tuesday connecticut delaware maryland and pennsylvania., senator bernie sanders won the primary in rhode island., clinton appeared to have added 170 delegates to her lead over sanders by the associated presss count clinton now has 88 percent of the delegates she needs to clinch the democratic nomination., as of 10 55 p.m. the ap projected that trump won at least 105 delegates compared with just five for ohio gov. john kasich and one for senator ted cruz., for both clinton and trump they showed that a long drawn out primary fight might be close to an end and that stubborn adversaries seemed to be running out of time., whether you support senator sanders or you support me there is much more that unites us than divides us clinton said., the crowd cheered at the pun and a bumper sticker with the slogan was already on sale for 5 dollars at clintons website., both men are now relying on long shot strategies which imagine that trump can also be stopped from reaching a majority of republican delegates and that the partys convention will bypass the leader and choose one them instead., and not only is it all five trump said at a news conference at trump tower in new york., he noted that he had passed 60 percent in results from several states., when you crack 60 with three people thats very hard to do., trump said he will be going to indiana on wednesday where the may 3 primary is shaping up as the last best chance for trumps rivals to stop him., he likened himself to a boxer winning by knockout when the boxer knocks out the other boxer you don t have to wait around for a decision., trump also tried to pivot toward a general election although his attack on clinton seemed more improvised that clintons bumper sticker ready attack on him., if hillary clinton were a man i don t think she would get 5 percent of the vote he said., even before the polls closed tuesday night cruz was conceding the expected losses however he showed no indication of withdrawing from the race., tonight donald trump is expected to have a good night he said speaking to supporters in knightstown ind. in the gym where the movie hoosiers was filmed., but then cruz said that the race would turn his way in states such as indiana tonight this campaign moves back to more favorable terrain., kasich was running second in several of tuesdays primaries but it was a distant second hardly an affirmation of the theory that the governor would compete well with trump among the more moderate republicans of the east., it is about transforming our nation sanders said at the outset of his remarks to a crowd of about 6 400. & \"The author begins this section by explaining that donald trump won all five primaries in the republican race for president, a sweep that illustrated his dominance along the eastern seaboard.

      "1294 & washington in the next presidential election republican leaders are hoping to win among young voters something they haven t done since 1988 before many of todays young voters were born. but winning over the current crop of young adults millennials won t be easy. they are more liberal than their parents even when they identify as republican. they rely heavily on social media to which the republican party has been slow to adapt. and although several republican candidates and the party itself are trying to appeal to them some of the youngest party members say they simply aren t feeling the love. personally national party leaders have been relatively non existent in response to our generation said alexander staudt 21 a university of iowa senior and president of students for rand paul. this is one thing that disappoints me that our age group has effectively been disenfranchised due the general lack of motivation by party leaders to drive the youth to vote. traditionally young adults vote in smaller percentages than their elders. but in a tight election their vote can make a difference. in 2012 60% of voters under 30 voted for president barack obama giving him the edge he needed to defeat republican mitt romney. that explains why this time around the republican party and many republican party candidates are working harder to appeal to young voters. the republican national committee has posted on its website profiles of young adult campaign workers or gop millennials photos of young people attending debate parties and registering voters and a link for college students to become campus captains to educate their classmates on republican candidates. individual candidates and their supporters also are working to attract millennials the generation born after 1980. senator rand paul of kentucky launched an 11 campus college tour to connect with students. the campaign of retired neurosurgeon ben carson has a group called students for carson which regularly hosts debate parties at college campuses. businesswoman carly fiorina appeared in a well received video on buzzfeed a news site popular with younger voters. and a student at claremont mckenna college in california started the millennials rising pac a super pac that supports former florida gov. a number of republican candidates are taking steps to reach millennials through social media said kei kawashima ginsberg director of the tufts university center for information and research on civic learning & engagement which studies young peoples political engagement. carson has aggressively engaged social media and has more facebook fans upwards of 4.87 million than any other candidate. fiorina and trump have hosted live chats on periscope an app popular with millennials. and arguably no candidates twitter account is more active than donald trump s. matt moore a millennial who is chairman of the south carolina republican party crowed about the latest republican party outreach efforts. the rncs leaders especially reince priebus really get it. thats why you are seeing such innovative ideas on connecting with young voters said moore 33 one of the youngest members of the republican national committee. the rnc has opened an office in silicon valley not only to attract the best and brightest tech minds to the political arena but to show our commitment to the innovation economy. nevertheless republicans face a number of challenges. millennials are more liberal than any other age group and even those who are republican or who grew up in conservative households consider themselves more progressive than their parents particularly on social issues according to the pew research center. young conservatives are more likely than their older counterparts to support gay rights immigrants and environmental regulations positions more closely aligned with the democratic party. some millennial republicans say they have trouble getting the party elders to hear them. lilia dashevsky 18 a former chair of the arizona teenage republicans said helping the old guard understand their progressive positions on social issues is a major challenge for younger conservatives. many people are hesitant to listen to us or even give second thought to our opinions and beliefs because they are different from the republican norm she said. we should be the open tent party; it is extremely attractive for young people to feel included and accepted dashevsky added. we are all about social inclusion and listening to opposing ideas while formulating our own thoughts based on our personal experiences. that vision of an open tent party has taken a beating during a year in which various republican candidates have advocated building a wall to keep out immigrants deporting undocumented immigrants and preventing syrian refugees from settling in the united states perhaps there is one issue that best illustrates the challenges republicans face in winning over millennials more than 60% of young republicans support same sex marriage pew reported. every one of the republican presidential candidates opposes it. candidates positions aside republicans start out at a numerical disadvantage among young voters. millennials are the most democratic of any generation pew found. slightly more than half of them identify as democrats or lean democratic while just 35% are or lean republican. president obama won two terms due to his overwhelming success among young and minority voters said moore the south carolina republican chair. in 2016 and beyond our party faces a demographic tidal wave unless we get ahead of it. despite the obstacles the candidates see some openings. for instance like republicans in general many millennials are economic conservatives. in fact this generation is the most fiscally conservative since the great depression preferring to save rather than invest their money according to a study by ubs wealth management americas. students are graduating from college with very bleak job prospects and in most cases very high debt said garrison coward the 25 year old political director for rep. we are running the risk of being the first generation that may not do better than our parents generation. senator marco rubio of florida is responding to that sentiment both in his language he talks a lot about creating a new american century and in his policy proposals. he is proposing to reduce student debt by establishing repayment plans that are based on income. he also promotes the sharing economy businesses such as uber and airbnb that are popular with millennials because they offer peer to peer exchanges as a fiscally conservative alternative to the traditional way of doing things. marcos message about a new american century obviously speaks directly to the hopes and dreams of young americans said rubios communications director alex conant. the entire purpose of our campaign is to ensure that future generations of americans have the same opportunities to achieve the american dream that our parents and grandparents did. in addition many of the millennials who say they lean democratic actually are independent voters. most millennials are not familiar with party structures; they just want to be involved coward said. so it is important for us to find non conventional ways to get millennials involved in the sometimes mundane party processes especially on the state levels. therein lies another problem. across the partisan divide is a candidate who is something of a superstar among the young adult crowd. and even if he doesn t win the democratic nomination senator bernie sanders has tapped into a passion among millennials that could not accrue to the partys ultimate nominee. sanders a septuagenarian who represents vermont has addressed large crowds on college campuses as he rails against income inequality advocates free tuition at public colleges and universities and argues that the government should reduce the burden of student loans. he also has met with millennials who are pushing for criminal justice reform. our campaign attracts millennials because we ve put forth an aggressive agenda that speaks to the real and pressing needs of young people make college affordable create jobs to reduce high youth unemployment and fight climate change for future generations said kenneth pennington sanders digital director. it doesn t take much to sell bernies agenda to young voters. we just need to get it in front of more people. democratic frontrunner hillary clinton is working to reach millennials through an aggressive use of social media by appearing on late night talk shows and rolling out more than 100 students for hillary chapters across the country said xochitl hinojosa a campaign spokeswoman. the campaign has made it a priority to engage millennials through policy positions like marriage equality college affordability and addressing student debt climate change and providing people with economic opportunity including increasing wages she said. in the end it will be up to the candidates to show millennials they care about them and about the issues that most concern young adults said kristen soltis anderson author of the selfie vote where millennials are leading america. ultimately the gops success with millennials will come down to the nominee and the extent to which he or she makes millennials a priority she said. i believe most republicans now understand that they can t lose young voters by 20 plus points and still expect to win the white house but it remains to be seen if they will do what it takes to win them back. & presidential election republican leaders are hoping to win among young voters something they haven tmany of todays young

The author notes that no other supreme court nominee in history has been held up for this long, and that the nomination is \"now pending longer than any supreme court nominee in history.\" The author also argues that the next president could not nominate as many as three more justices, because the next president would only be able to nominate one replacement for the late Antonin Scalia.\", \"The author argues that the republican majority in the senate should vote to confirm Garland to the supreme court because there is no better time than the present to ensure a conservative appointed to the court to serve for the next several decades.

He is well respected in the legal community and has the support of both Democrats and Republicans.  The White House attempted to block Garland\\'s nomination in March but was unsuccessful.

The author then makes the case that both Clinton and Sanders have an advantage in getting those candidates to the Democratic National Convention in July, but that Clinton has a significant delegate lead that would be difficult for Sanders to overcome. The author then goes on to talk about the importance of this win for both Trump and Clinton, as it seemed to close the window on the primary fight and set the stage for the general election.

The author first states that republican leaders are hoping to win over the current crop of young adults millennials (defined as people born between 1980 and 2000) because they are more liberal than their parents even when they identify as republican. The author then states that republican party has been slow to adapt to social media and that although several republican candidates and the party itself are trying to appeal to millennials, some of the youngest party members say they simply aren\\'t feeling the love. The author then explains that although young voters historically have voted in smaller percentages than their elders, in a tight election their vote can make a difference and that in 2012 60% of voters under 30 voted for president barack obama giving him the edge he needed to defeat republican mitt romney. The author then argues that the republican party is working harder to appeal to young voters because the republican national committee has posted on its website profiles of young adult campaign workers or gop millennials, photos of young people attending debate parties and registering voters and a link for college students to become campus captains to educate their classmates on republican candidates.\", \"The rnc opened an office in silicon valley, calif. to attract the best and brightest tech minds to the political arena, as well as to show their commitment to the innovation economy. this is because republicans face a number of challenges, including lack of voter enthusiasm, and being out of power in congress and the white house. however, the outreach to millennials through social media is a step in the right direction, as republicans have a hard time connecting with this demographic. for example, donald trump has the third highest twitter following of any presidential candidate, but he is not favored with millennial voters. the rnc has opened an office in silicon valley, calif. to attract the best and brightest tech minds to the political arena, as well as to show their commitment to the innovation economy.\", \"The author of this news article argues that millennials are more liberal than any other age group and even those who are republican or who grew up in conservative households consider themselves more progressive than their parents particularly on social issues.\", \"The main evidence provided by the author is that slightly more than half of them identify as democrats or lean democratic while just 35% are or lean republican. president obama won two terms due to his overwhelming success among young and minority voters said moore the south carolina republican chair. in 2016 and beyond our party faces a demographic tidal wave unless we get ahead of it. despite the obstacles the candidates see some openings. for instance like republicans in general many millennials are economic conservatives. in fact this generation is the most fiscally conservative since the great depression preferring to save rather than invest their money according to a study by ubs wealth management americas. students are graduating from college with very bleak job prospects and in most cases very high debt.\", \"the author attempts to justify his party\\'s support of a septuagenarian by arguing that millennials will only get involved in the political process if the party gives them non conventional options. by supporting a septuagenarian the party is able to attract the attention of millennials who otherwise would not be involved in the political process. the millennials who do get involved will be more engaged and therefore more likely to participate in the party\\'s mundane processes such as voting in primary elections and general elections. the millennials who do not support the democratic party are not really independent voters as the author claims. they are simply not involved in the political process. the author\\'s claim that the democratic party attracts millennials because of their aggressive agenda is also false. the aggressive agenda of the democratic party is to reduce income inequality. the millennials who support the democratic party are not concerned with climate change or reducing the burden of student loans.\", \"the article attacks republicans for not realizing how important millennials are to their future electoral success and how important it is to win them back. the article points to the success democrats had in winning over young voters in the recent presidential election as proof that millennials will vote for a candidate if that candidate shows them they care about them and the issues that are important to them. the article argues that republicans must make millennials a priority if they expect to win them back.\"'\n",
