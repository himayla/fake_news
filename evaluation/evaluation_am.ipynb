This is clearly a political attack, as she has long supported the coal industry and the associated jobs.  However, she is correct in that the coal industry is not what it once was, and her attempt to eliminate it entirely would result in more severe job losses in the region.  As of now, she is the Democratic candidate for president, and the republican candidate, Donald Trump, has expressed similar views on the coal industry, so it is likely that the coal industry will continue to decline under either candidate.\"\n"
