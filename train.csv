exclusively for government business was colin powell contrary to clintons claim that her predecessors plural did the same thing.', 'the ig also said that like clinton powell did not comply with policies on preserving work related emails.', 'but the ig report said the comparison to powell who did not use a private server only goes so far.', 'it said during clintons tenure the rules governing personal email and the use of nongovernment systems were considerably more detailed and more sophisticated citing specific memos that warned department employees about the security risks of not using the government system.', 'secretary clintons cybersecurity practices accordingly must be evaluated in light of these more comprehensive directives the report said.', 'brian fallon a clinton campaign spokesman told us that even though the ig report contradicts clintons past statements that doesn t make her statements untruthful.', 'he said clinton who declined to be interviewed by the inspector

secretary of state from january 2009 to february 2013.', 'the associated press followed with a report that clintons email account was hosted on a private server at her home in new york.', 'the result is a 79 page report that identified systemic weaknesses... that go well beyond the tenure of any one secretary of state.', 'it made eight recommendations to the department.', 'for our purposes we reviewed the report in the context of statements that clinton the front runner for the democratic presidential nomination has made about her unusual email arrangement since it was first disclosed more than a year ago.', 'as we have written before clinton has said her email arrangement was allowed by her department and fully above board.', 'even after the report came out clinton continued to make this claim saying in an abc news interview on may 26 that it was allowed.', 'the ig report says that that was not the case.', 'the ig report said that it has been department policy since 2005 four years before clinton took office that normal day to day operations be conducted on government servers.', 'the report also said that in 2007 the department adopted additional policies requiring non departmental information systems used to process or store department information to meet the same security controls as the departments systems and requiring that they be registered with the department.', 'state department inspector general may 26 the departments current policy implemented in 2005 is that normal day to day operations should be conducted on an authorized automated

arrangement.', 'if she did the report says her request would have been denied by the bureaus of diplomatic security and information resource management.', 'the ig report says it found many examples of staff using personal email accounts to conduct official business.', 'but the report also made a distinction between occasional use and exclusive use of personal email.', 'the report said it found only three department employees in 19 years who used non departmental systems on an exclusive basis and two of them were secretaries of state.', 'the other was jonathan scott gration a former ambassador to kenya who ignored instructions in july 2011 not to use commercial email for government businesses and resigned in mid 2012 when the department initiated disciplinary action against him.', 'he departments response to his actions demonstrates how such usage is normally handled when department cybersecurity officials become aware of it the report said.', 'clinton has insisted that she complied with that records requirement too because she senator emails to department staffers who had government email addresses.', 'at a march 10 press conference when she first took questions about her unusual email arrangement clinton said the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the state department.', 'the ig report said that is not the case.', 'it said clintons method of preserving work related emails was insufficient under the federal records act.', 'fallon the clinton spokesman said we agree in retrospect with the ig finding that her practice of copying aides on her emails did not end up producing a full record since states it systems didn t save everything.', 'but that doesn t mean she didn t take steps to comply.', 'our goal was to explain her state of mind at the time because she was copying and sending emails to people within the state department fallon said.', 'she believed that all those emails were captured he said.', 'on multiple occasions clinton has said she was not alone in using personal email for government business.', 'that is correct but she distorts the facts when saying that what she did was the same as other secretaries of state as she did in a cnn interview on in a march 9 debate and again in the abc interview on may 26 after the report came out.', 'she was wrong to say my predecessors did the same thing as we have pointed out before.', 'the ig report confirms that among clintons predecessors only powell

'secretary of state john kerry who followed clinton told the inspector generals office that he infrequently used personal email for government business when responding to a sender who emailed him on his personal account.', 'even now clinton twists the facts when she claims as she did in the abc news interview that personal email use was the practice for other secretaries of state meaning powell and kerry.', 'it was the practice for powell but it was the exception for kerry so the plural use of secretaries is misleading especially in light of the ig report.', 'in what reads like a direct rebuttal to clintons claim that other secretaries of state have done the same thing the ig report notes that the departments policies on the use of personal email and nongovernment computer systems were considerably more detailed and more sophisticated during clintons tenure.', 'it said she should be evaluated differently than her predecessors.', 'beginning in late 2005 and continuing through 2011 the department revised the fam and issued various memoranda specifically discussing the obligation to use department systems in most circumstances and identifying the risks of not doing so the report says.', 'in addition to the policies we outlined from the mid 2000s the report noted specific instances in which state department officials acted to discourage the use of personal email for government business.', 'what followed was a cable that went out under clintons name that recommended best practices for department users and their family members to follow including avoid conducting official department business from your personal e mail accounts the report said quoting from clintons cable.', 'the report also addressed some other notable issues clinton admits she made a mistake when she decided to use a personal email and server to conduct public business.', 'the ig report makes it clear that occasional use of personal email for government business would have been acceptable as long as clintons emails were preserved by the department before she left office.', 'we added that fallon said the clinton campaign agrees with the ig finding that her practice of copying aides on
