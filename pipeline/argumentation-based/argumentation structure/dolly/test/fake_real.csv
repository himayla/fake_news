0,1503,"Hillary Clinton moved closer to the Democratic presidential nomination with two contests this weekend as she and Sen. Bernie Sanders continued a fierce contest in California ahead of voting Tuesday that is likely to make Clinton the winner of a bruising primary battle. Late Sunday, Clinton won the Democratic primary in Puerto Rico, according to early returns. On Saturday, she overwhelmingly won caucuses in the Virgin Islands. Clinton spent the day speaking at an African American church in Oakland, Calif., and seeking to shore up support among younger Latino voters. Sanders campaigned in West Hollywood and elsewhere in Southern California. In Puerto Rico, 60 pledged delegates and seven superdelegates were at stake, and Clinton was expected to capture a large majority of them. Sanders and Clinton are in a statistical tie in delegate-rich California, forcing her to mount a late statewide press to avert an embarrassing loss on the same night she is widely expected to capture enough delegates to claim the nomination. As he shook hands with brunch-goers Sunday afternoon in West Hollywood, Sanders re­iterated his belief that there will be a contested convention. “ Absolutely, ” he said when asked by a reporter if that remains his view. Sanders, wearing a loose sky-blue shirt with his sleeves rolled up under the hot sun, ducked down for selfies at Joey ’ s Cafe with young people who were sipping smoothies and eating plates piled with eggs and French toast, and he urged them to vote Tuesday. He was flanked by his wife, Jane, and Secret Service agents. Sanders then roamed throughout the block, waving to crowds that gathered in the neighborhood, a community known to be supportive of gay and transgender rights. “ We ’ ll stand up and make it clear that it is too late for establishment politics and establishment candidates. We need real change in this country, ” Sanders told a crowd at Hamburger Mary ’ s that spilled out onto the street. “ And we need a government which represents all of us, not just the 1 percent ! ” Even a blowout for Sanders in California would not close Clinton ’ s big lead over him among pledged delegates. Sanders ’ s claim that he still has a way to claim the nomination would depend on him winning a huge share of superdelegates who have not yet announced their preference, plus persuading some superdelegates already committed to Clinton to swing to him. Neither is likely. [ How Bernie Sanders missed his chance to beat Hillary Clinton ] Clinton has spent most of her time campaigning in California without mentioning Sanders, but that has begun to change in recent days as the race has gotten closer. Several polls show Sanders within two points of Clinton. In response to the growing pressure, Clinton has returned to critiquing Sanders over his past opposition to immigration-reform legislation. “ It is true we got close to immigration reform, ” Clinton said in Los Angeles, recalling a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill that failed when she, Sanders and President Obama were then in the Senate. “ President Obama and I voted for it, and Senator Sanders voted against it. ” “ It was heartbreaking, ” she said, referring to the bill ’ s failure. Sanders has said he voted against the legislation because it did not sufficiently protect farmworkers. But Clinton ’ s allies also think that younger Latinos are not fully aware of her past work on immigration issues, including registering voters in Texas, working with the families of farmworkers as a teen and advocating for immigration reform legislation in the Senate. “ Immigration is at the center of this presidential campaign, ” Clinton said at Mission College as she sat at a lunchroom table sandwiched between two children of undocumented immigrants. “ This is very personal to me. ” [ Clinton looks to shore up support among younger Latinos in California ] Sanders ’ s top advisers said Sunday that the campaign would not accept any declaration by Clinton or party leaders that Clinton is the presumptive nominee. “ They ’ d be wrong, ” Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Sanders, said in an interview Sunday in Santa Monica, Calif. “ The reality is this is going to the convention. ” [ Bernie Sanders, eyeing a ‘ contested convention, ’ urges media to hold off on calling race ] Although the Puerto Rico primary was a relatively low-key affair, the territory offers more delegates than about half of the other Democratic contests, including the first four in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Puerto Rico is among U.S. territories that can hold nominating contests and award delegates despite not being able to vote in the general election. A candidate needs 2,383 delegates to win the nomination. Some voters endured waits of more than two hours — or gave up entirely — because of long lines at polling stations, according to multiple reports on site. The commonwealth, which is amid a financial crisis, reduced the number of polling stations by more than two-thirds from the more than 1,500 originally announced. Sanders supporters complained vociferously on social media. An MSNBC reporter said that the Democratic Party blamed the Sanders campaign in part because it had requested a reduction in sites, citing a lack of volunteers to monitor them. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs called the allegation “ total bunk. ” Briggs said the campaign had instead urged the Democratic Party to maintain the more than 1,500 polling stations promised. “ They can not blame their shoddy running of the primary on our campaign, ” he said in a statement late Sunday. Sanders made a campaign trip to Puerto Rico last month and has been airing television ads there. Clinton went there in September. The politics of a pending bailout of the cash-strapped island has figured in the campaign. Sanders said last week that he plans to introduce his own bill dealing with the Puerto Rico debt crisis after having slammed an effort supported by Obama and House leaders that Sanders said would make “ a terrible situation even worse. ” The House bill has drawn criticism from some other quarters as well. Clinton has expressed concerns, but said she wants to see the bill move forward to stop Puerto Rico ’ s problems from worsening. Phillip reported from Oakland, Calif. ; Gearan, from Washington.

1,1122,"The new year is a time of optimism and new commitments. For me, it ’ s also a powerful time for an additional reason : Every Jan. 8, I think about how close I came to losing my life on a bright winter morning five years ago in Tucson, when a would-be assassin opened fire on me and a group of my constituents, injuring 12 others and killing six. I was shot in the head from three feet away, but somehow I survived. I made a decision that my new life would be lived as my old life was : in service of our country. One thing that means for me today is using my second chance to do everything I can to make this great country safer from the kind of gun violence that took the lives of those around me and changed many others ’, and mine, forever. Instead of focusing on what I can not do, I have tried to live without limits. I ’ ve set myself tougher and tougher goals. I ’ ve learned and delivered speeches. I jumped out of an airplane. I spent the night on one of our Navy ’ s aircraft carriers, the USS Carl Vinson. I ’ ve taken my French horn out of its case for the first time in years. This November, I rode 40 miles in Tucson ’ s annual charity bike ride, El Tour de Tucson. And with my husband, Mark Kelly, I have fought to make sure our leaders finally do something to save the lives of the 33 Americans who are murdered with a gun every day. [ This is what its like to be a victim of everyday gun violence ] Today, five years after I was shot, we are making progress. While Congress refuses to act, many state leaders are embracing common-sense change that keeps guns out of the wrong hands. This week, we made even more progress when President Obama announced that his administration will significantly narrow the loopholes that let people buy guns without a background check. It is the right, responsible thing to do. The president ’ s reasonable proposal addresses a lethal problem : People who are in the business of selling guns can avoid the current requirement to conduct background checks on their buyers by claiming not to be gun dealers. Go to a gun show, for example, and in booths right next to licensed gun dealers whose customers have to undergo background checks, you will see others who operate outside of the rules, selling dozens or hundreds of the same guns each year without background checks. The steps announced this week will narrow that gap by requiring anyone who sells a significant number of guns or operates like a commercial dealer to get a license and require each buyer to pass a criminal background check. Truly private sales, such as simply selling a gun to a neighbor or a friend, will not be affected. But, based on analysis by the gun-violence-prevention organization I co-founded, millions of firearms transactions that currently happen with no questions asked will be subject to background checks. The president ’ s proposal makes another key improvement : It addresses the weakness in the background-check system that authorities say allowed a dangerous man to buy a gun and murder nine innocent people in a Charleston, S.C., church. It does this by making the system more efficient and effective, including by increasing the number of background-check examiners and related staff members by 50 percent and reporting which states do and don ’ t provide essential background-check records to the FBI. Other important provisions will require gun dealers to report lost and stolen guns, making it easier for law enforcement to crack down on the illegal gun trade ; and will increase investment in gun safety technology and mental-health treatment. These are just common sense. Almost three years ago, when a minority of senators caved in to their fear of the corporate gun lobby and blocked sensible, bipartisan background-check legislation in Congress, I said that those senators had failed their constituents and, with every preventable gun death, made shame their legacy. Many of those same senators, along with a lot of other elected officials and some candidates for president, will be quick to haul out the talking points the gun lobbyists in Washington gave them and attack the president ’ s reasonable action. They will warn of dire consequences and willfully spread misinformation. But the truth is this : These new steps will hurt no one, and they will protect many. Around mile 32 of the bike ride I did in November, I almost gave up. I ’ m mostly paralyzed on my right side, and even though I had been training for months, my body was tired and it was hard to keep going. But I remembered my goal. I had a team of friends and supporters with me, so we just kept pedaling together. And then we crossed the finish line. Reducing the number of Americans murdered or injured by guns is also not easy. It ’ s a long, hard haul. But we can not falter now, and we can not wait for a Congress in the gun lobby ’ s grip to prevent any of the 12,000 gun murders that happen in our country every year.",REAL
