2700,beirut (reuters) nothing so encapsulated the political shackles in which saad al hariri has operated as lebanons prime minister as the way he resigned in a televised statement made from saudi arabia every major decision by the unlikely politician was determined by factors beyond his control he entered politics after the 2005 assassination of his father and his resignation served the agenda of riyadh the dependence of their leaders on powerful external patrons is nothing new in lebanon where regional powers from saudi arabia to iran have long tussled for geopolitical advantage but the case of hariri who many lebanese think was summoned to the saudi capital coerced into resigning and put under house arrest which he has denied underscores an instance of external pressure extreme even by lebanons high standards in an interview on sunday he said he will return to lebanon in the coming days and might reconsider his resignation even if he does the events of the past 10 days show how decisions taken beyond lebanons borders would still define his role his shock resignation statement on nov 4 which has thrust lebanon into a new political crisis included a laundry list of saudi complaints about the behavior of iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah riyadhs main political adversaries iran and hezbollah hariri said are sowing strife in the arab world as riyadhs ally at a time of its enemies ascendancy hariri was already playing lebanons intricate political game from a position of weakness a year ago after spending years abroad he agreed to join a national unity government with president michel aoun a former rival and hezbollah ally that included hezbollah itself it was a compromise he said was necessary to end lebanons sectarian tinged political paralysis and one that was personally difficult as hariri accuses hezbollah of the assassination of his father rafik al hariri he seemed committed to that compromise until the moment he flew to riyadh on nov 3 telling officials of discussions planned for his return the following monday saudi arabia had previously accepted hariris political bargain in lebanon but irans trumpeting of its successes along with hezbollah in the wars in syria and yemen at the expense of saudi allies may have altered riyadhs calculation a day after traveling to riyadh hariri appeared on television reading a statement of resignation hariris career was built on the backing of gulf states the deployment of his family fortune spending large amounts of it in lebanon to finance a media network and charitable gifts to secure widespread support and feelings of respect among many lebanese for his late father in his resignation address saad said we are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of rafik al hariri in lebanons sectarian system the prime minister must always be a sunni muslim and rafik made his family pre eminent among lebanese sunnis rafik carved out a business empire in saudi arabia with the backing of its ruling family and returned to lebanon to rebuild when the civil war there ended in 1990 serving twice as prime minister the car bomb that killed rafik gave saad little choice but to adopt a previously unsought role as political leader before being plunged into lebanons volatile politics saad had led a playboy lifestyle running his fathers business he was raised in saudi arabia and has saudi nationality outrage at rafiks killing helped hariris movement to electoral victory five months later and he installed a political ally as prime minister not taking the post himself until 2009 it was the first government headed by factions opposed to the influence of syria and by extension damascus allies iran and hezbollah since the 1975 90 lebanese civil war that opposition came to a head in 2008 when the government tried to seize hezbollahs telecommunications network triggering street battles in beirut that the heavily armed shi ite muslim movement won qatar brokered a compromise with hariri becoming head of a coalition government that included hezbollah but hezbollah pulled out in 2011 bringing down the administration as tensions rose over the war in neighboring syria hariri left lebanon spending most of the ensuing years abroad until he returned months before joining a new government last year but his sway and that of his familys regional patron saudi arabia had diminished the formation of last years government was widely seen in lebanon as an acknowledgement of the political dominance of iran and hezbollah saudi arabias own apparent impatience with hariri became evident in the fortunes of the family company saudi oger whose billions had underpinned their political role in lebanon with a new dispensation in riyadh under king salman and his ambitious son prince mohammed and a fall in oil prices damaging its finances the saudi government seemed less willing to roll out big state projects to enrich some allies when hariris first stint as premier ended in 2011 he said in a newspaper interview in lebanon it is never over for anyone a source in his camp said a compromise to bring him back to beirut as prime minister was still possible if aoun distanced himself from hezbollahs regional role such a statement by aoun might give some satisfaction to saudi arabia but it would seem to leave hariri no stronger than before after so public a departure especially one delivered from abroad his dependence on riyadh has been made especially visible his enemies in lebanon even mocked his arabic during his resignation speech as being more saudi than lebanese and the posters of him that have appeared across beirut with the slogan we are with you looked less like statements of mass support than solidarity with a political hostage.,REAL

2592,islamabad/washington (reuters) a kidnapped us canadian couple and their three children born in captivity have been freed in pakistan nearly five years after the couple was abducted in neighboring afghanistan pakistani and us officials said on thursday american caitlan coleman and her canadian husband joshua boyle were kidnapped while backpacking in afghanistan in 2012 by the taliban allied haqqani network which the united states has long accused pakistan of failing to fight us president donald trump who has been highly critical of islamabad praised pakistans cooperation with the us government over the freeing of the hostages saying it represented a positive moment for us pakistan relations the pakistani governments cooperation is a sign that it is honoring americas wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region trump said in a statement trumps chief of staff john kelly drove home the dire conditions that the family had been subjected to during its long captivity they versus been essentially living in a hole for five years kelly said thats the kind of people we are dealing with over there it was unclear how precisely the pakistani military secured the familys release which came after the united states shared intelligence about the hostages location it was also unclear when the family would return home two us officials speaking on condition of anonymity told reuters that the us military had been ready to fly the family out of the country but said boyle who is canadian had refused to board the aircraft boyle had once been married to the sister of an inmate at the us military detention center at guantanamo bay the marriage ended and the inmate was later released to canada as of thursday evening there was no indication the family had left pakistan boyles parents said he told them by phone he would see them in a couple of days so we are waiting for that his mother linda boyle said in a video posted on the toronto star newspapers website us officials expressed hope that the hostages freedom could not represent a turning point in relations between pakistan and the united states uneasy allies in fighting taliban and other islamist extremists in the region in recent days senior us officials have been more pointed about islamabads alleged ties to militant groups who are battling against us and us backed forces in a stalemated 16 year old war in neighboring afghanistan some us officials say pakistani safe havens have helped prolong the conflict pakistan fiercely denies such ties and it touted the operation as proof of the strength of the alliance the success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and pakistans continued commitment towards fighting this menace through cooperation between two forces against a common enemy a pakistani army statement said boyles father in the video message offered his thanks to pakistani forces who risked their lives and got all five of ours out safely and rescued the toronto star reported that boyle told his parents that he was in the trunk of the kidnappers car with his wife and children when they were rescued by pakistani forces boyle said he sustained minor shrapnel wounds during the shootout which left his kidnappers dead the last words boyle said he heard from the kidnappers were kill the hostages the star reported the pakistani army said its forces were able to recover the hostages after acting on us intelligence about their passage into pakistan from afghanistan the white house pentagon and state department did not offer details about the pakistani effort even as it praised cooperation from islamabad but one us official speaking on condition of anonymity said there was no indication that the hostages had been in afghanistan in the days before they were freed contrary to the pakistani account the united states believed the hostages were probably held by the haqqani group in or near its headquarters in northwestern pakistan the entire time two other us officials said declining to discuss us intelligence in detail that was shared with pakistan they said the united states had been tracking cars capable of holding six or more people moving from place to place which analysts had concluded were suggestive of moving hostages it was a matter of interdicting vehicles another us official told reuters saying the united states never dictated to pakistan how precisely to secure the hostages release canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland asked for respect for the familys privacy joshua caitlan their children and the boyle and coleman families have endured a horrible ordeal over the past five years we stand ready to support them as they begin their healing journey freeland said coleman was pregnant at the time she was kidnapped and a video released by the taliban in december showed two sons born while she and her husband were hostages thursdays statements from islamabad and washington were the first mention of a third child some officials said pakistanis motive for freeing the hostages may have been political rather than humanitarian intended to reduce the tensions ahead of upcoming visits by secretary of state rex tillerson and defense secretary jim mattis tillerson in a statement said trumps strategy in the region recognized the important role pakistan needs to play to bring stability and ultimately peace to the region mattis who last week said the united states would try one more time to work with pakistan in afghanistan was upbeat on thursday this is a very positive moment and the pakistan army performed well mattis told reporters during a trip to florida.,REAL

467,november 5 2016 fort russ exclusive interview and translation by jafe arnold (j arnoldski) eduard popov born in 1973 in konstantinovka donetsk region is a rostov state university graduate with a phd in history and philosophy in 2008 he founded the center for ukrainian studies of the southern federal university of russia in rostov on don from 2009 2013 he was the founding head of the black sea caspian center of the russian institute for strategic studies an analytical institute of the presidential administration of russia in june 2014 popov headed the establishment of the representative office of the donetsk peoples republic in rostov on don he has actively participated in humanitarian aid efforts in donbass and has been a guest contributor to various donbass media such as the lugansk based cossack media group popov has actively contributed to fort russ since june 2016 *** fort russ special editor jafe arnold dr popov for nearly half a year already you have regularly submitted your commentary on global events to fort russ you ve covered a number of topics ranging from european politics and the war in donbass to the possibility of a third world war breaking out over syria and the future of ukraine and ukrainian nationalism before we begin discussing a number of related questions what would you like to say to your readers at fort russ? dr eduard popov i consider the rare and somewhat unexpected honor to address you dear readers of the wonderful analytical site fort russ to be some kind of reward for my future contributions i see this not as a right but as a sacred duty of the author before his readers we live in different countries speak different languages and share different (ranging from more or less similar to diametrically opposite) worldviews and political opinions nevertheless to some extent we are all like minded the common denominator for all of us is the strong belief that the world is multifaceted and cannot be reduced to only one correct doctrine the history of mankind has seen and will probably still see more than a few attempts at organizing an ideological and political monopoly the ideology of the american new world order that claims universality and all inclusiveness is nothing original and not even clever as a historian of political ideologies revolutionary communism in its trotskyite and khrushchevite variants also immediately comes to mind which also claimed for itself the role of ending world history but the era of american domination over the world awaits its finale and is maybe more imminent than many of us expect i see my own personal mission as an author at fort russ to help prepare this finale which depends on the efforts of every one of us restoring the violated principle of national sovereignty instead of the idea of one nations global domination restoring the blooming complexity of the worlds cultures instead of an imposed and dull liberal “post culture and affirming solid moral principles instead of immoral promiscuity this is a sample program which is shared by the majority of humanity most of humanity is opposed to the dominant quasi religion of american neoliberalism or rather the ideology of pax americana is opposed to the majority of humanity the events in the former ukraine and donbass have become some of the reference points determining each of ours moral position people from different countries and with opposing political views from ultra right to ultra left have expressed support for the people of donbass and i am very grateful to fort russ for constantly striving to present the truth of these events i ve had the opportunity to personally observe the astonishing events in donbass and i can say that donbass fate is still far from sealed together we are contributing to a more just alternative not only for donbass but for all of humanity eduard popov (left) dpr representative in rostov on don with moscow dpr representatives arnold in this context how do you assess the state of the ongoing global information war? are resources like fort russ helping to turn the tide against the atlanticist narrative or “pax americana? is bringing together such “like minded people the main goal of this information war? popov it is difficult for me to assess the state of the whole front of the information war i don t possess complete information and don t consider myself a specialist in this sphere i m simply a political analyst and historian specializing in some topics that are relevant in todays world nevertheless i have no doubt as to the benefit that “new media brings to the resistance movement let me explain these terms new media means independent publications that do not legally fall under the category of media but fulfill the same function this applies to different websites and groups on social media the “resistance movement (i don t think the origin of the term needs to be explained) is a synonym for anti globalism or as has become fashionable to say now the anti mainstream if de gaulles movement fought against the nazi occupation of france with weapons in hand then todays fighters of the resistance fight mainly with information against an occupant operating not so much with direct physical violence as with distanced coercion ie informational psychological economic and political force etc can it be said that the fight against this new occupation is more difficult? as a historian by education and a philosopher (my doctoral dissertation was on the political philosophy of conservatism) i believe that the world has now arrived at the complete breaking point of one historical epoch and the beginning of another perhaps it wouldn t be so wrong to compare the current era with the era of the collapse of the roman empire first and foremost because ahead of us is most likely a dark ages comparable to the early middle ages and a new great migration of peoples of course not everything is the same but i won t focus on this now i ll just say that there are not too many reasons for historical optimism resources such as fort russ have taken on the extremely important mission of speaking the truth in an epoch of great lies “big official publications in europe are filled with lies and this is not only my opinion all the thinking honest europeans with whom i ve discussed the situation of the press in united europe also think so hence why as my friends in european countries have noted independent media has a growing circle of readership in my opinion this trend is a long term one as for what i believe is necessary to concentrate efforts on the first step has already been done the minimum social anti mainstream has been formed in europe this has been done primarily thanks to the efforts of the independent press but in my opinion the task fulfilled at this first stage has goals primarily centered around negation ie proving what is wrong and dangerous in globalism the anti mainstream wields an unusually rich diversity of worldviews and ideological shades ranging from marxism to certain currents of fascism to even clerical monarchism why not use this methodological richness for forming a united anti globalist intellectual front? then we can proceed to solve constructive tasks such as discussing the foundations of a future more just world order in no case should the resistance movement identify as marginals this is precisely how the “ministry of truth tries to present it if a number of new media take on the mission of creating platforms for intellectual discussions with others then this will undoubtedly become one of the main tasks of the information war even the leader of the bolsheviks vladimir lenin spoke of a newspaper as a center not only of publications but as a center for party work i don t know if the creators of new media have read lenin but they are acting according to his methodological precepts arnold a t the present moment o ne of the centers of attention of the information war and what you called the “resistance is the threat of a third world war being unleashed by the us russian experts have different opinions on how realistic such a turn is considering that you say there is little reason to be historically optimistic what do you think? popov the topic of ww3 is really actively being discussed in russian expert circles yet all the while has the status of some kind of fantasy but as i said earlier we are now witnessing the breaking point of not only a historical period (what immanuel wallerstein calls the american century century lasting since 1945) but a change in historical epochs this can be compared with the collapse of the roman empire or the collapse of the middle ages and the onset of the modern age the russian philosophers of the emigration in the 1920s foresaw this shift of epochs and called it the new middle ages perhaps this was also an anticipation of fascism which lasted a comparatively brief historical period in my opinion this also anticipates the new middle ages but with only one necessary correction this will be a new early middle ages not the high middle ages of great romano germanic culture which the russian philosopher konstantin leontyev considered to be the highest achievement of humanity but the “dark ages that preceded it barbarism the plague the collapse of the great ancient cultures and the mass migration of peoples a very vivid impression of these centuries is offered by the german epics (the genesis of the historical basis of the nibelungenlied dates back to the dark ages and the invasion of attila the hun) and scandinavian mythology especially the tale of the death of the gods this change of epochs is primarily being prepared on mental grounds i believe that the conditions are ripe for this the western world has finally turned into a post christian and partially anti christian entity it is difficult for me to say whether europe has enough life left in it to oppose the new onslaught of the caliphate i have in mind muslim migration to the european continent and the expansion of salafist networks the answer is more likely no than yes america is also going through very difficult times although its difficulties are of an entirely different nature wallerstein long ago said that the age of american domination is coming to an end and will end with a grandiose crash this conclusion is in a certain measure shared by the ideologist of pax americana brzezinski who called to negotiate not to prevent but to slow down the collapse of the american empire the americans have a very high level of strategic thought both times that america entered a world war on the european continent it achieved grand strategic successes with very little blood shed (compared to the european allies and axis) there are many works that substantiated by references to historical sources show that the us stood behind the scenes of ww2 and pushed european rivals to war the us entered the war as the most powerful economy on the planet and came out with the status of a superpower the successor to the british empire the us gdp increased 10 times in only a few years we can also see outstanding though not as tremendous achievements of american geopolitics in ww1 europe was gushing blood but the united states profited from and became stronger because of the war between european competitors even the british now that the age of the usa is coming to an end they are faced with the threat of having to drastically reduce their appetites busy themselves with overhauling renovations at home and turn from the lord of the world into a first among equals i am almost sure that the us will not go down the path of isolationism for psychological (the inertia of imperial power is very strong) and economic reasons this means they will continue down the path of foreign expansion russia and china are becoming all the more stronger and independent rivals of the us russia is increasing its military power while china is increasing its economic power even though it should be noted that china and the us are vitally needed by each other as economic partners at the present stage meanwhile europe does not wield geopolitical subjectivity and remains the us junior partner but this is threatening its overall economic and productive capacity which is surpassing the us i ll suggest an opinion and perhaps re invent the wheel the “arab spring was sponsored by the americans in order to organize a new great migration of peoples to europe in the long and even medium term the islamic world is not an ally of the us but in the short term such an alliance is possible american strategists are using the mixing of peoples and languages to greatly weaken their european competitors other tools are being used against china and russia and this toolbox is quite large the americans have attempted to wage a cheap war against russia by creating a powerful protest movement against president putin perhaps we can already say that this venture failed the russian people and other peoples of the russian federation unlike their ukrainian neighbors wield historical and state wisdom and are ready to endure hardships in the face of an external enemy this makes war almost inevitable time is working against the us and for russia by 2020 or 2025 the program of rearming the armed forces of russia should be completed and the economy is not in the best condition but can still cope with crises therefore i ll repeat war is an inevitable way out of the impasse will this be a real third world war? in my opinion this is unlikely in one of my articles i ve already employed the notion of a “flank war the americans are largely fighting by proxies polish ukrainian and muslim salafist ones etc the almost inevitable (in my opinion) victory of hillary clinton will add psychological motives to this war what is entailed in this scenario? two things (1) the russians and americans will fight without the use of strategic nuclear weapons and on fronts far away from us shores otherwise the cure for the american empire war would be worse than the disease; (2) i am sure that the american hegemon will be defeated in this war and this offers the opportunity to begin to liberate europe and for russia this means the opportunity to finally throw off the burdensome shackles of american tutelage to be

war we are inamericans believe that they are exceptional because their country is exceptional so the left eagerly swarms to argue that america is not exceptional except maybe that it is exceptionally badamericans believe that individuals succeed with hard work obama and elizabeth warren bray that you didn t build that americans believe in religion and family the left sets out to destroy them by proving that these institutions are evil and oppressive religious leaders are pedophiles the family is setting for abuse that makes gay people feel bad when the dust settlers the only good religion and family are the kind defined by the left having destroyed the existing system of organization the left replaces it with its own that is the ultimate goal of a culture war not mere destruction but absolute powerthe culture war begins by attacking abstract ideas then it attacks organizations then it attacks peopleby attacking the ideas it undermines the organizations based on them so that it can seize control of them or destroy them once thats done it controls a sector of society and begins enforcing its conformity agenda on individuals much of that is underway the war is drilling down to the individual level we are approaching the tyranny thresholdat the individual level the goal of the culture war is to destroy your will to resist them the left has many tools for doing thisplease read the entire piece by daniel greenfield this culture war we are inobama escalates cultural genocideit isn t enough to invite illegal aliens to invade the usa in their numberless hordes and then quickly distribute them along with their exotic diseases throughout the country obama is now using your money to fly them directly from central america so as to save them the bother of traveling through mexico to facilitate the often treacherous process of entering the united states illegally through the southern border the obama administration is offering free transportation from three central american countries and a special refugee/parole program with resettlement assistance and permanent residency the new arrivals will be officially known as central american minors (cam) and they will be eligible for a special refugee/parole that offers a free one way flight to the us from el salvador guatemala or honduras the project is a joint venture between the department of homeland security (dhs) and the state departmentreaders will recall that dhs was originally set up to defend the homeland under the orwellian obama regime it is in charge of orchestrating an invasion of the homelandafter pearl harbor some feared a japanese invasion it would have been preferable to what is happening to us now if the imperial japanese had successfully invaded they would have ruled for a time but eventually would have been kicked out the current invaders aren t going anywhere and they reproduce much faster than americansplus the japanese never expected us to pay them to invade us the candidates will then be granted a special refugee parole which includes many taxpayer funded perks and benefits among them is a free education food stamps medical care and living expenses a state department official promoted cam as a family reunification program that will be completely funded by american taxpayers though the official claimed to have no idea what the cost will bewho can put a price on the future?the fig leaf of refugees being allowed into the country ahead of immigrants likely to make a positive contribution because their lives are supposedly in danger has been droppedthe state department official assured that applicants need not express or document a credible fear to qualify under cam because we want to make sure this program is open to as many people as possible consider this as part of the bigger picture of what is being done to america and it goes beyond treason it is cultural genocideour rulers know exactly what they are doing from the official federal propaganda outfit voice of america americas demographics are changing like never before in less than 30 years whites will no longer be the racial majority in the united stateson the large scale race and culture are inseparable americans are effectively becoming a minority within our own country our own democracy will be used against us to relegate us to a permanent second class status (as south

46,the republican presidential nominees claim that the election is being rigged against him represents the most outlandish moment yet in a campaign devoted to dismantling political norms trump might not be the first candidate to feel nefarious forces are moving to keep him from the white house presidential elections have occasionally been disputed after votes are counted and have often been marred by accusations of dark instruments of fraud such as the dead casting votes but trumps claim three weeks before election day as many voters are already going to the polls that the race is being being deliberately stacked against him by a fearful political establishment flies in the face of historical precedent and should he lose it threatens the legitimacy of those left to govern after the most anarchic election in modern history remember we are competing in a rigged election trump said at a wisconsin rally monday night they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common his accusations alone experts say could not inflict long standing damage on the us political system itself by eroding trust in the probity of the electoral process ever since a weary george washington rode home to mount vernon in 1797 american democracy has rested on a cherished principle the transfer of power from an outgoing president to a successor widely seen as legitimate the most important thing in the system is that the winners win and the losers lose said march braden former chief counsel of the republican national committee almost as important as that is that the rational people that support the loser believes that the winner won one of trumps republican party primary rivals florida sen marco rubio rejected trumps claims that the election is being rigged trumps accusations come as his campaign slips further behind democrat hillary clinton three weeks from election day prompting him to deal in ever more conspiratorial claims that shield him from culpability in his own fate and there is every sign that his most loyal supporters accept his warnings that a horror show is taking place and that the election could not be stolen history has seen accusations of election swaying before from john f kennedys henchmen allegedly cheating richard nixon out of the presidency in 1960 to the infamous hanging chads of the florida recount in 2000 but trumps repeated claims that the election is already being rigged are the electoral equivalent of the nuclear option essentially he is saying in advance that the election is illegitimate rather than challenging the results after signs of wrongdoing once the votes are counted history is replete with illegal things going on during elections but at this point in the 21st century to make the grandiose statement like trump is that the election is rigged is bogus it is anti democratic spirit it is anti american at its core said cnn historian douglas brinkley from rice university on cnns new day on monday ohios republican secretary of state jon husted told cnns carol costello on monday that his state makes it easy to vote but hard to cheat i can assure donald trump that i am in charge of elections in ohio and they re not going to be rigged i ll make sure of that husted said but trump has been long been warning that the election could not be stacked against him he claimed that the republican primary race could not be rigged against him and used the idea that he and his followers were being persecuted by the political establishment as a device to motivate his political base he has returned to the theme of a venomous washington political establishment rigging the vote on and off for weeks he claimed in west palm beach on thursday that the media was in lock step with clintons campaign as part of a global conspiracy by fearful elites to make her president but his accusations hit a new intensity late last week and over the weekend the election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing crooked hillary but also at many polling places sad trump tweeted on sunday of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day why do republican leaders deny what is going on? so naive! trump added on monday trump has also raised doubts about the integrity of the election in the crucial swing state of pennsylvania and has several times urged supporters to show up at polling places to ensure no fraud is perpetrated an order that appears to risk voter intimidation but trump ally rudolph giuliani the former mayor of new york city said on cnns state of the union on sunday that he would have to be a moron to assume that there would be no electoral fraud in democratic run cities like philadelphia and chicago yet there is no actual evidence that trumps claims about 2016 are true and the billionaire has certainly not provided any suggesting a massive fraud unknown in us history is under way we have had corruption in the 19th century there have been controversies when elections were contested and decided in congress such as in 1824 said princeton university history professor julian zelizer referring to a vote ultimately decided by the house of representatives the presidency was awarded to john quincy adams after none of the four candidates won a majority of the electoral votes but it is virtually impossible in 2016 to rig an entire election zelizer said it is decentralized it is fragmented and there is very little evidence that this could not happen several recent academic and government studies have also shown infinitesimal levels of electoral fraud despite claims by republicans that it is widespread an effort liberals say is part of a widespread campaign to restrict poll access that could not disproportionately disqualify minority voters who tend to back democrats meanwhile pressure is rising on key republicans to repudiate trumps claims house speaker paul ryan released a statement through a spokeswoman on saturday saying that he is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity but neither ryan nor senate majority leader mitch mcconnell have spoken out in person for fraud to take place republican officials who are in charge of the voting systems in swing states like ohio florida iowa and north carolina would have to turn a blind eye towards conduct designed to keep their own party nominee from the presidency or participate in doing so trumps own running mate indiana gov mike pence appeared to split with his partner on sunday we will absolutely accept the results of the election he said on nbcs meet the press on monday however he suggested that irregularities were a real problem and embraced trumps notion that the media elite are an extension of the clinton campaign and therefore also part of the hoodwinking given that trump has branded himself in politics business and life as the ultimate winner the prospect of a crushing defeat in november on the grandest stage must be a bitter one so pre spinning a possible defeat may represent a face saving way out he is hedging himself against a loss if he does lose he can say that is a fraud said jessica lavariega monforti chair of the department of politics at pace university new york he might also think a close election is likely and is laying the groundwork for a legal challenge much now depends on whether trump pulls off a come from behind victory in which case he will presumably withdraw his accusations of fraud or claims that a loss is the product of widespread electoral fraud charges that could not prompt many americans to view a clinton presidency as illegitimate but should he have second thoughts and choose to fall into line with historical precedent in the dying moments of his campaign he has plenty of examples to look to in 1960 nixon chose not to challenge the result even though some advisors wanted him to reasoning that he could not damage his own political future and that the fate of the nation was on the line i want senator kennedy to know and i want all of you to know that certainly if this trend does continue and he does become our next president that he will have my wholehearted support nixon told supporters on election night in 2000 after the supreme court closed off his last hope of claiming florida and a majority of electoral college votes after a bitter weeks long fight vice president al gore conceded to george w bush with grace almost a century and a half ago sen stephen douglas told abraham lincoln who had just defeated him for the presidency partisan feeling must yield to patriotism i m with you mr president and god bless you gore said well in that same spirit i say to president elect bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside and may god bless his stewardship of this country gore said the question now after a deeply rancorous election that has cleaved partisan divides ever deeper is whether either trump or clinton could not summon those words about each other three weeks from tuesday.,REAL

1404,[white might burning courtesy informed content ] =by= juan cole w hether trump wins or loses (and in my view there isn t much chance he can win) he will leave behind a toxic legacy of increased racial and religious hatred which he has deliberately stirred up in order to take the focus off his policies policies that will hurt workers and will throw even more money at the super wealthy this use of racism to divide the working class and whip up support for the business classes is as old as american capitalism trump has whipped up sentiment against latinos and immigrants (a minority of americans of latino ancestry is first generation immigrants) by loudly proclaiming that they are guilty of all kinds of crimes in fact violent has fallen 48% in the us since the early 1990s yet in the past 25 years immigration has soared research shows that immigrants commit less crime than the native born it isn t hard to figure out why first those who don t yet have citizenship are afraid of being deported so they keep their noses clean but more importantly and contrary to what trump alleges immigrants are go getters who have taken the big step of leaving home to accomplish something they are highly motivated to succeed and often bring with them a great deal of human capital as for jobs immigrants aren t stealing them from the native born they are doing different jobs than locals with the same educational attainments thats because they often don t have as good english skills or can t afford to turn down menial jobs the hatred against immigrants trump has fostered is based on a set of lies lies that are easily shown to be falsehoods but it is a little unlikely that this hatred of foreigners will subside wednesday whatever happens trump has given aid and comfort to the american far right with his racist dog whistles (and often just unadorned racism) he has emboldened the ku klux klan alt right and other disgusting organizations david duke of louisiana has been encouraged to run for the senate and is pledging to be trumps biggest supporter this genie will be hard to put back into its lamp trump has encouraged hatred for muslims in the us on an unprecedented scale hatred for muslims has already been adopted as a latent platform by the republican party but they are usually at least a little more subtle about it if trump can succeed in discriminating against muslim americans he can then proceed to discriminate against the rest of us on one pretext or another muslim americans are only 1% of our population there isn t actually any danger of them taking over the country or imposing their religious law and most terrorism comes from the far right or from overseas not from native born muslim americans trump supporters have already burned down a mosque in florida have assaulted muslims (and sikhs whose men wear turbans) all over the country and some trumpists have plotted terrorism against muslims trump has left a legacy of contempt for women and a resurgent patriarchy he has juvenilized women and hurled slurs at them he accused megyn kelly of being on her period when she asked him sharp questions he boasted about grabbing strangers by the genitals his message is that women should be judged not by their intelligence hard work or character but by their breast size and figure and the symmetry of their faces trump has taken optimistic trend lines and pulled them down into sheol with him he has diminished our country traumatized our children and made us laughingstocks in the urbane capitals of the world he leaves us a large bequest tied up with a bow of hatred and prejudice smelling like the piece of dog shit that is donald trump note to commenters due to severe hacking attacks in the recent past that brought our site down for up to 11 days with considerable loss of circulation we exercise extreme caution in the comments we publish as the comment box has been one of the main arteries to inject malicious code because of that comments may not appear immediately but rest assured that if you are a legitimate commenter your opinion will be published within 24 hours if your comment fails to appear and you wish to reach us directly senator us a mail at editor@greanvillepostcom we apologize for this inconvenience nauseated by the had enough of their lies escapism omissions and relentless manipulation?.,FAKE

594,written by jacob g hornberger the latest massacre of many innocent people by us forces in afghanistan provides another demonstration as to why it is imperative that the american people stop deferring to the authority of the national security state and demand the immediate withdrawal of all us forces from afghanistan in a war that has now gone on for 16 years us forces just killed at least 32 more civilians many of whom were children another 25 people were wounded of course this is on top of all the wedding parties hospitals and other victims of us bombing attacks that have brought the death toll from us interventionism in afghanistan to more than 200 000 not to mention the wounded maimed homeless and refugees in the last seven days alone 95 civilians have been killed in afghanistan and 111 injured how many of those 30 people including the children who are now being buried had anything to do with the 9/11 attacks? it is a virtual certainty that none of them did how did this latest us massacre occur? afghan government forces assisted by us troops decided to raid a home in a densely populated neighborhood in a village where a taliban commander was supposedly having a meeting the soldiers got trapped in a narrow dead end street where they began taking enemy fire from surrounding homes so what did they do? naturally to save their lives they called in air strikes which necessarily involved firing missiles into the neighborhood which killed those 32 people including children the us militarys position is the standard one the military regrets the loss of innocent life but they say they didn t really have a choice if they didn t fire the missiles the us and afghan troops would be killed if they did fire the missiles the innocent people living in the neighborhood would die not surprisingly the military chose to protect the lives of the soldiers at the expense of those innocent people living in the neighborhood but lets be mindful of an important fact if us troops had not still be intervening in afghanistan there never would have been a us bombing raid on that neighborhood how do the people who survived the massacre feel about what happened? not surprisingly they were chanting “death to america! americans should think about that the next time there is a terrorist attack in the united states despite the bombing attack two us soldiers captain andrew byers and sgt first class ryan gloyer were killed in the battle what did they die for? no they did not die protecting our freedom or keeping us safe thats nothing but pabulum for the families of those two soldiers to make them feel okay about losing their loved ones fthey died for nothing the same thing that those 58 000 plus us soldiers died for in vietnam freedom and security of the american people have nothing to do with americas 16 year war in afghanistan the taliban are not coming to get us any more than the north vietnamese were coming to get us the conflict in afghanistan is nothing more than a civil war one in which one side is battling to oust a regime that has been installed into power by the us government once the us presidential race is over a race in which the 16 year old war in afghanistan has barely been mentioned the american people need to demand an immediate end to the us occupation of afghanistan continued us interventionism is accomplishing nothing positive and is only pouring fuel on the fire making matters worse for everyone including innocent women children and others in afghanistan reprinted with permission from the future of freedom foundation related.,FAKE

julian assange if you look at the history of the fbi it has become effectively americas political police the fbi demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the cia [general david petraeus] over classified information given to his mistress almost no one is untouchable the fbi is always trying to demonstrate that no one can resist us but hillary clinton very conspicuously resisted the fbis investigation so there is anger within the fbi because it made the fbi look weak we ve published about 33 000 of clintons emails when she was secretary of state they come from a batch of just over 60 000 emails [of which] clinton has kept about half 30 000 to herself and we ve published about half breaking #assange #clinton resisted #fbi and now they re out for payback (watch full john pilger exclusive on rt) then there are the podesta emails we ve been publishing [john] podesta is hillary clintons primary campaign manager so there is a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay for play as they call it giving access in exchange for money to states individuals and corporations [these emails are] combined with the cover up of the hillary clinton emails when she was secretary of state [which] has led to an environment where the pressure on the fbi increases russian government not the source of clinton leaks jp the clinton campaign has said that russia is behind all of this that russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for wikileaks and its emails ja the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo mccarthy hysteria that russia is responsible for everything hilary clinton stated multiple times falsely that seventeen us intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications that is false; we can say that the russian government is not the source wikileaks has been publishing for ten years and in those ten years we have published ten million documents several thousand individual publications several thousand different sources and we have never got it wrong saudi arabia & qatar funding isis and clinton jp the emails that give evidence of access for money and how hillary clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically are quite extraordinary i m thinking of when the qatari representative was given five minutes with bill clinton for a million dollar cheque ja and twelve million dollars from morocco … jp twelve million from morocco yeah ja for hillary clinton to attend [a party] jp in terms of the foreign policy of the united states thats where the emails are most revealing where they show the direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism of isil in the middle east can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of isil are actually those who have helped create it ja there is an early 2014 email from hillary clinton not so long after she left the state department to her campaign manager john podesta that states isil is funded by the governments of saudi arabia and qatar now this is the most significant email in the whole collection and perhaps because saudi and qatari money is spread all over the clinton foundation even the us government agrees that some saudi figures have been supporting isil or isis but the dodge has always been that well it is just some rogue princes using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that no it is the governments of saudi and qatar that have been funding isis jp the saudis the qataris the moroccans the bahrainis particularly the saudis and the qataris are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hilary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales particularly to saudi arabia ja under hillary clinton the worlds largest ever arms deal was made with saudi arabia [worth] more than 80 dollars billion in fact during her tenure as secretary of state total arms exports from the united states in terms of the dollar value doubled jp of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the clinton foundation ja yes jp thats extraordinary clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition ja i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of [the reaction] to their ambitions she represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states the question is how does hilary clinton fit in this broader network? shes a centralising cog you ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like goldman sachs and major elements of wall street and intelligence and people in the state department and the saudis wikileaks emails shows citigroups major role in shaping obama administrations cabinet shes the centraliser that inter connects all these different cogs shes the smooth central representation of all that and all that is more or less what is in power now in the united states it is what we call the establishment or the dc consensus one of the more significant podesta emails that we released was about how the obama cabinet was formed and how half the obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from city bank this is quite amazing jp didn t citybank supply a list … ? ja yes jp … which turned out to be most of the obama cabinet ja yes jp so wall street decides the cabinet of the president of the united states? ja if you were following the obama campaign back then closely you could not see it had become very close to banking interests assange sorry for clinton as a personality (john pilger exclusive courtesy of dartmouth films) ja so i think you can t properly understand hillary clintons foreign policy without understanding saudi arabia the connections with saudi arabia are so intimate libya is hillary clintons war jp why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of libya? can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us told you about what happened there? because libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in syria the isil jihadism and so on and it was almost hillary clintons invasion what do the emails tell us about that? a very different kind of warfare clinton team on benghazi committee leaks in #podestaemails ja libya more than anyone elses war was hillary clintons war barak obama initially opposed it who was the person championing it? hillary clinton thats documented throughout her emails she had put her favoured agent sidney blumenthal on to that; there is more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand hillary clinton emails that we ve published just about libya it is not that libya has cheap oil she perceived the removal of gaddafi and the overthrow of the libyan state something that she would use in her run up to the general election for president so in late 2011 there is an internal document called the libya tick tock that was produced for hillary clinton and it is the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the libyan state which resulted in around 40 000 deaths within libya; jihadists moved in isis moved in leading to the european refugee and migrant crisis not only did you have people fleeing libya people fleeing syria the destabilisation of other african countries as a result of arms flows but the libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it libya faces along to the mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of africa so all problems economic problems and civil war in africa previously people fleeing those problems didn t end up in europe because libya policed the mediterranean that was said explicitly at the time back in early 2011 by gaddafi what do these europeans think they re doing trying to bomb and destroy the libyan state? there is going to be floods of migrants out of africa and jihadists into europe and this is exactly what happened trump won t be permitted to win jp you get complaints from people saying what is wikileaks doing? are they trying to put trump in the whitehouse? assange comey & clinton the assange twilight zone (e354) ja my answer is that trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that? because hes had every establishment off side; trump doesn t have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them an establishment but banks intelligence [agencies] arms companies… big foreign money … are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and even journalists themselves jp there is the accusation that wikileaks is in league with the russians some people say well why doesn t wikileaks investigate and publish emails on russia? ja we have published about 800 000 documents of various kinds that relate to russia most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia most of which are critical our [russia]documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia which they use our documents to back up jp do you yourself take a view of the us election? do you have a preference for clinton or trump? ja [lets talk about] donald trump what does he represent in the american mind and in the european mind? he represents american white trash [which hillary clinton called] deplorable and irredeemable it means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan urbane perspective these people are like the red necks and you can never deal with them because he so clearly through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies represents people who are not the middle not the upper middle educated class there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting trump in any way including any criticism of hillary clinton if you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power that makes absolute sense us attempting to squeeze wikileaks through my refugee status jp i d like to talk about ecuador the small country that has given you refuge and [political asylum] in this embassy in london now ecuador has cut off the internet from here where we are doing this interview in the embassy for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the us election campaign can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on ecuadors support for you? pro hillary us state dept behind assange internet cutoff wikileaks activist to rt ja lets let go back four years i made an asylum application to ecuador in this embassy because of the us extradition case and the result was that after a month i was successful in my asylum application the embassy since then has been surrounded by police quite an expensive police operation which the british government admits to spending more than £126 million they admitted that over a year ago now there is undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of london between ecuador a country of sixteen million people and the united kingdom and the americans who have been helping on the side so that was a brave and principled thing for ecuador to do now we have the us election [campaign] the ecuadorian election is in february next year and you have the white house feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing wikileaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of ecuador from this embassy or in the territory of ecuador; we publish from france we publish from from germany we publish from the netherlands and from a number of other countries so that the attempted squeeze on wikileaks is through my refugee status; and this is this is really intolerable [it means] that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organisation; [they] try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the american people and others about an election jp tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy ja i would be immediately arrested by the british police and i would then be extradited either immediately to the united states or to sweden in sweden i am not charged i have already been previously cleared [by the senior stockholm prosecutor eva finne] we were not certain exactly what would happen there but then we know that the swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the united states we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the us has requested since at least 2000 so over the last fifteen years every single person the us has tried to extradite from sweden has been extradited and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that won t happen] jp people often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here ja look one of the best attributes of human beings is that they re adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable they adapt and start to tolerate abuses they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses they adapt to adversity and they continue on so in my situation frankly i m a bit institutionalised this [the embassy] is the world it is visually the world [for me] jp it is the world without sunlight for one thing isn t it? ja it is the world without sunlight but i haven t seen sunlight in so long i don t remember it jp yes ja so yes you adapt the one real irritant is that my young children they also adapt they adapt to being without their father thats a hard hard adaption which they didn t ask for jp do you worry about them? ja yes i worry about them; i worry about their mother i am innocent and in arbitrary detention jp some people would say well why don t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to sweden? ja the un [the united nations working group on arbitrary detention] has looked into this whole situation they spent eighteen months in formal adversarial litigation [so it s] me and the un versus sweden and the uk whos right? the un made a conclusion that i am being arbitrarily detained illegally deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the united kingdom and sweden and that [those countries] must obey it is an illegal abuse it is the united nations formally asking whats going on here? what is your legal explanation for this? [assange] says that you should recognise his asylum [and here is] sweden formally writing back to the united nations to say no we are not going to [recognise the un ruling] so leaving open their ability to extradite i just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press because it doesn t suit the western establishment narrative that yes the west has political prisoners it is a reality it is not just me there is a bunch of other people as well the west has political prisoners of course no state accepts [that it should call] the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons political prisoners they don t call them political prisoners in china they don t call them political prisoners in azerbaijan and they don t call them political prisoners in the united states uk or sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self perception ja here we have a case the swedish case where i have never been charged with a crime where i have already been cleared [by the stockholm prosecutor] and found to be innocent where the woman herself said that the police made it up where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum those are the facts but what is the rhetoric? jp yes it is different ja the rhetoric is pretending constantly pretending that i have been charged with a crime and never mentioning that i have been already previously cleared never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up [the rhetoric] is trying to avoid [the truth that ] the un formally found that the whole thing is illegal never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes i am subject to persecution by the united states note all image captions pull quotes and commentary by the editors not the authors.,FAKE

657,(cnn) cnn commentators and guest analysts in iowa and new hampshire offer their take on the latest republican presidential candidate debate the opinions expressed in these commentaries are those of the authors errol louis with trump gone substance is center stage the big republican debate winners were sen ted cruz sen marco rubio gov john kasich and ex gov jeb bush who got an opportunity to talk about issues and engage one another without the looming presence of donald trump in past debates moderators and other candidates wasted valuable time clearing the never ending backlog of personal insults outrageous proposals and made up facts by trump without trump onstage candidates and questioners alike could not talk about the substance of the race for president issues like immigration policy national security and the governments role in growing the economy cruz rubio and bush had room to embark on an especially illuminating debate about who championed which side in the failed 2013 effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation aided by moderators who played videos of cruz and rubio appearing to favor a path by which undocumented immigrants might become citizens a position now considered soft by the conservative base of the republican party we are not going to round up 12 million people but we are not going to go around handing out citizenship cards either rubio said his rivals pounced rubio cut and run when opposition to the legislation sprang up said bush cruz seconded that assessment drawing a harsh response from rubio ( this is the lie that teds campaign is built on he said) it wasn t pleasant but it also wasn t crazy or clouded by petty personal wisecracks and it gave viewers a good look at the candidates position on immigration the debates losers were the candidates sen rand paul dr ben carson and gov chris christie who resorted to gimmicks but simply failed to shine paul had supporters in the hall who loudly shouted after every statement by him but pauls anti interventionist approach to national security marked him as an outlier in his own party carson wandered into a word salad in one answer about how to deal with russia ( putin is a one horse country oil and energy ) and at the end of the debate instead of giving a closing statement oddly recited the preamble to the constitution and said folks it is not too late enough said christies one liners seemed practiced rather than powerful (the days of the clintons in public housing are over ) the debates winners go into the iowa caucuses with a last minute lift; the losers according to the polls were already floundering and got no help from their performance as is generally the case donald trump was a nonfactor in this debate the only difference this time is he wasn t actually there yet again ted cruz marco rubio and chris christie emerged as the best debaters of the night with rand paul benefiting from the additional time afforded by trumps absence if you re one of the 40% of iowa caucus goers who are reportedly still undecided you got a great education in the differences between the substantive candidates in the republican party primary tonight from immigration to isis vets issues to criminal justice reform it was an enlightening informative night tangentially while debates are not jeb bushs strong suit he was far more focused and relaxed tonight perhaps because he wasn t distracted by the orange one for once his defense against being perceived as establishment joyfully bearhugging his mom dad and brother was the kind of easy going good natured and confident jeb that his supporters should want to see more of winner marco rubio from style to substance and even in the face of attacks from nearly every candidate on the stage rubio proved he has the chops to take on hillary clinton or bernie sanders as the voice of a new generation he was quick on his feet studied disciplined personable decisive funny and natural in a night focused on cruz he overshadowed runner up chris christie the drumbeat that hes delivered conservative policy to liberal new jersey is effective and compelling his disciplined focus on continually turning the debate back on clinton forces you to visualize him in the general election it is clear for christie the primary is just temporary housing where for some others the primary is where they plan to retire second runner up republican voters who finally got a fully substantive debate devoid of trumps incoherent blurting and debate moderators trump fixation loser ted cruz don t get me wrong cruz was great tonight he looked like a frontrunner he delivered some effective lines his stance against ethanol subsidies in iowa was right and courageous given the room but if anyone had a better performance (and i believe rubio and christie did) with the stakes this high with trump absent with iowa on the horizon it is a loss for him se cupp is the author of losing our religion the liberal medias attack on christianity co author of why you re wrong about the right and a columnist at the new york daily news this was the first debate where the republican candidates had a chance to speak without donald trump standing among them on the stage most of the candidates took shots at ted cruz rubio raised questions about why cruz supported budgets that cut defense spending marco rubio questioned cruzs claim that he was the most conservative candidate in the race saying that he would do or say anything to get votes chris christie characterized cruz as part of the washington establishment while rand paul who has been a non presence for months blasted cruz for claiming that everyone but him was for amnesty cruz stumbled when he displayed some of his temper he tried to talk when it was not his turn and complained that every question revolved around attacking him he was booed when he refused to be quiet without trump by his side in fact cruz seemed much smaller rubio also struggled when he had to watch the montage of video that revealed his changed positions on immigration policy cruz had to sit through a similar montage of his own on immigration was there actually a winner? if there was it was probably donald trump as cruz and rubio took some shots to their reputation the low voltage atmosphere made it clear why so many voters were more interested in hearing and following trump on the campaign trail someone absent from the debate stage was targeted early and often by candidates seeking to impress iowa caucus goers in a surprising twist it wasn t donald trump marco rubio and chris christie avoided challenging the man whos way ahead of them in early state and national polls while treating multiple questions as invitations to attack hillary clinton from his first answer to his closing remarks and several times in between rubio promised to beat the democratic frontrunner ( hillary doesn t want to run against me but i can t wait to run against her ) he reminded viewers that clinton floated president barack obama as a possible supreme court appointee echoing lines he tested in earlier debates rubio asserted that use of a private email server and actions related to the benghazi attack had disqualified clinton from being president former us attorney christie repeatedly pressed his electability argument saying he can best prosecute the case against hillary clinton a question about fighting isis in libya took a detour toward more criticism of the former secretary of state who has so much to answer for but has refused to be held accountable sounding more confident than in any previous debate jeb bush twice assured republicans he can beat clinton with the proven record of accomplishment she lacks rand paul stayed out of the hillary bashing game and didn t mention her except when asked about bill clintons conduct he capitalized on being back in the primetime scrum by hitting key points that set him apart from the competition audit the fed criminal justice reform limits on nsa surveillance and being willing to look at all spending to balance the budget paul won t grab one of the famous three tickets out of iowa but he surely energized his fans and may outperform his recent polling numbers on monday night ted cruz and jeb bush neither helped nor hurt themselves (which could not be considered a win for cruz) john kasich is a nonfactor here well a republican debate can still produce winners and losers even without donald trump there to proclaim himself winner and call everyone else losers one clear winner was fox news especially moderator megyn kelly the questions were so hard hitting that ted cruz complained about them and the use of video clips to hold the candidates to their past statements was devastating also the fox bottom line surely benefited from what was by far the most ad time of any debate so far ultimately donald trump ended up being both the biggest winner and the biggest loser he lost by squandering the opportunity to rise above the squirmish (thanks for the word sarah palin) with megyn kelly and fox news and to look a little presidential in the process but trump was the winner because his poisonous populism has so utterly infused the republican party that all of the candidates to some degree sounded like trump on the issues sons of immigrants rubio and cruz both have adopted trumps xenophobic vitriol on immigration and refugees and both cruz and christie gleefully parroted trumps empty saber rattling approach to isis if as chris wallace said at the outset there really is a battle for the soul of the party the republican party may have already sold that soul to donald trump donna brazile a cnn contributor and a democratic strategist is vice chairwoman for civic engagement and voter participation at the democratic national committee a nationally syndicated columnist she is an adjunct professor at georgetown university and author of cooking with grease stirring the pots in america we can thank donald trump for having boycotted thursday nights republican party debate his absence created some breathing space for the other candidates viewers got the chance to consider candidates characters and platforms without the billionaire showmans dominating and divisive presence at the same time this debate suggests that trump has had an energizing effect on his rivals communication style they have sharpened their stances adopted a more muscular and simple delivery and paid more attention to the emotional impact of their messages not all candidates wish to follow the trump method of persuasion john kasich ben carson jeb bush and rand paul have remained true to themselves in terms of public presentation which in this election cycle has cost them in the polls but chris christie with his habit of looking directly at the camera has learned trumps lessons he kept his pugnaciousness but added some emotional softness when appropriate marco rubio was emphatic and engaged banishing thoughts of his baby face and booties ted cruz gave some fine answers as on health care reform but came across as petulant and snarky he and rubio were clearly battling for second place standing ruth ben ghiat is a professor of history and italian studies at new york university and a specialist in 20th century european history her latest book is italian fascisms empire cinema while donald trump was down the road putting on his publicity stunt sideshow pandering to veterans the rest of the republican party field showed up and faced tough questions worthy of serious candidates running for the presidency the absence of trump gave voters the opportunity to finally judge the other candidates free and clear of the trump entertainment factor and distractions there was plenty of oxygen left in the arena this time and it seems as though jeb bush was the biggest beneficiary by far this was bushs strongest performance he even bested rubio in an exchange on immigration but it is just not enough to kick start his fledgling campaign bushs message doesn t inspire or represent the future whereas rubios does and that makes a huge difference when appealing to voters many expected ted cruz to shine tonight but his attempt to be snarky came across awkward and forced mostly falling flat as did his combative exchanges with the moderators chris wallace smacked cruz down after he complained about the questions (again) reminding him this is a debate rubio took some expected hits during the immigration exchange even though he offered a tough but pragmatic approach that would appeal to independents in a general election what set him apart in this debate were his cogent answers on defining the threats that face this country and how to defeat them particularly isis rubio consistently demonstrates a command of the issues and delivers his answers in direct relatable terms in almost every answer he managed to remind viewers of the disaster of the obama administration and why hillary clinton must be defeated by drawing that contrast rubio underscored why hes the candidate best suited to beat clinton losers ted cruz donald trump (for throwing a tantrum and not showing up) dean spiliotes rand paul gets back in the mix it should be clear to anyone watching this republican debate that it is marco rubio and not ted cruz who the other candidates on stage view as the greatest threat to their nomination chances beyond a missing donald trump initial expectations for the evening were that the debate would center on trumps absence and cruz as the iowa frontrunner in waiting but it was instead defined by several key exchanges between rubio and other candidates including rand paul on national security and jeb bush on immigration both paul and bush benefited from these exchanges as well but rubio despite seeming a bit overly amped and rehearsed at times used them effectively to attack president obama and hillary clinton of the three governors who were present on stage in iowa but who were primarily focused on new hampshire bush had a good night followed by chris christie who was second only to rubio in his obama and clinton bashing winners marco rubio and rand paul rubio for energetically holding his own as the center of attention and paul for turning in his sharpest debate performance thus far loser ted cruz who was off his game and did not live up to prior billing as frontrunner in waiting behind trump the ghost of donald trump loomed large over thursday nights republican party debate he was probably not far from the minds of many viewers we can imagine they would nod politely but inside long for the one who was not there all in all the republican party candidates demonstrated that without trump on stage it was difficult to hold americas attention the debate showed once again that none of the republican candidates (including trump) could not hold a candle to the democrats grasp of the issues americans care most about in the area of foreign policy the republican party candidates were a hot mess their answers were hyperbolic bellicose exaggerated and many times void of any facts their solutions untenable in the real world of governance and leadership on obamacare the environment planned parenthood immigration and a myriad of other domestic issues they were at times downright frightening again in the real world of real americans they talked about getting rid of obamacare which would strip millions of americans of health care they discussed defunding planned parenthood which would hurt low income women in accessing preventive care cancer screenings and birth control they won t fight for climate change which the global community is trying to fix they don t support real immigration reform and would deny a fair path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants who work hard and have deep roots in our communities (though jeb bush comes closest to acknowledging the need for reform) marco rubio was angry and preachy and blatantly pandered to christian conservatives every chance he got going right at ted cruzs base cruz tried to deflect all the incoming on stage he did well but seemed to wither at times most disconcerting to me and to millions of latino voters was how the two latino candidates fervently argued with each other over which one would treat latino immigrants worse gracias! and say adios to the casa blanca amigos! winners christie and paul did well but this debate will not change their standing much and of course donald trump in his absence demonstrated to his supporters that he does not adhere to the rules and will stand up for himself even against fox news the way he will stand up for america.,REAL

247,(cnn) days after patting himself on the back for not invoking them on a debate stage donald trump and his campaign are attempting to use bill clintons sex scandals to cast a shadow on hillary clinton for any candidate trailing by around 20 points with women in most national polling this plan of action might seem at best curiously wrongheaded but trump is a special case the twice divorced nominee who carried on a long affair that disintegrated his first marriage in a howling tabloid spectacle is uniquely unsuited to finger wagging still the irony does not seem to have resonated with his campaign brain trust on wednesday they put out talking points encouraging surrogates to chat about monica lewinsky gennifer flowers and paula jones a day earlier trump (who is overweight himself) hit back at claims he d body shamed a former miss universe by noting to fox news that she gained a massive amount of weight odd but not surprising especially when you consider the rogues gallery of advisers trump has drafted in over the past few months a pasty collection of older males mostly media executives and politicians with a long rap sheet of marital infidelities sex scandals and worse trump allies will be quick to point out that even as the candidate is again beset by sexism charges two of his most influential aides are women kellyanne conway was brought on to manage the campaign this summer and daughter ivanka alongside husband jared kushner is widely reported to be one of the few people that truly has his ear but the broader campaign firmament is less diverse heres a look at the trump boys club and its unsettling record bannons precise role on the campaign is still a bit of a mystery he was hired as the campaign ceo during a shake up in mid august taking leave from his top post at the right wing breitbart news operation to steady what was then a rapidly sinking ship the charges were eventually dropped but a police report from the time offers details of the womans injuries including mentions of red marks on her wrist and north carolina trump and ailes spoke frequently during the early stages of the race but it wasn t until the longtime fox news chief was ousted amid a sexual harassment scandal that he emerged as a more influential voice in the campaign according to some reports including providing debate advice multiple women have now come forward some with lawsuits alleging sexual misconduct a number of them in harrowing first person accounts provided to new york magazine and other outlets ailes has denied the harassment allegations against him but earlier this month 21st century fox reached a 20 dollars million settlement with former anchor gretchen carlson and agreed to a handful of other deals with women whose identities were not revealed ailes role going forward is a bit of a mystery but his presence certainly casts a shadow on any effort by the campaign to make inroads with skeptical women ditto for another informal adviser roger stone who has been working to undermine and insult clinton for years in 2008 he created a so called 527 group whose initials spelled out a crude term for a part of the female anatomy you re not supposed to gain 60 pounds during the year that you re miss universe said the former house speaker who has no known experience in or around beauty pageants rudy giuliani also on his third marriage giuliani currently on his third marriage ripped hillary clinton on monday night for staying with her husband despite his multiple affairs she didn t just stand by (bill clinton) she attacked monica lewinsky and after being married to bill clinton for 20 years if you didn t know the moment monica lewinsky said bill clinton violated her and was telling the truth then you re too stupid to be president he told a reporter from elite daily after the debate giulianis second marriage to donna hanover came to a very public and nasty end back in 2001 as the still married mayor stepped out publicly with girlfriend judith nathan often bringing her to the mayors residence at gracie mansion when hanover protested giuliani lawyer raoul felder told reporters his clients wife was howling like a stuck pig in her request to ban nathan from the home michael cohen said men can t rape their wives the comment came in response to a question about allegations made in a deposition during their divorce proceedings and revealed in a 1993 book that trump had raped his first wife ivana in 1989 trump has denied it and ivana subsequently backed off the claim saying she felt violated but did not want her words taken in a literal or criminal sense the new jersey governor has been one of the few close aides to offer trump what a source described as a brutally honest assessment of his performance in new york.,REAL

523,a pumped up donald trump strutted in front of a crowd of diehard supporters in pennsylvania on monday night throwing aside a spiraling disaster of the groping tape republican defections and his plummeting poll ratings the republican presidential nominee made no reference at a rally in the old coalmining town of wilkes barre to the catastrophic 72 hours his campaign had endured since an 11 year old recording was released in which he bragged about using his celebrity status to sexually assault women nor did he refer to the many members of his party who abandoned him publicly over the weekend in protest at his offensive comments or to the dramatic headway made by his democratic rival in the polls instead he fired up his loyal army of followers by repeating the threat he made directly to hillary clintons face at the second presidential debate on sunday night that once ensconced in the white house he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her alleged crimes when the baying crowd at mohegan sun arena shouted “lock her up! trump shot back at them “lock her up is right! but in his effervescent post debate mood he merely succeeded in generating further controversy he praised the group that acted as conduit for one of the biggest leaks of us government secrets in history “wikileaks i love wikileaks he said and he also managed to adopt an erroneous report by a russian government sponsored news agency relating to a recent wikileaks stash of documents hacked from the emails of clintons campaign chairman john podesta trump reading from an account of the document dump told his supporters at the wilkes barre rally that clintons longtime adviser sidney blumenthal “sleazy sidney as he called him had senator an email to podesta in which blumenthal said it was legitimate to question whether clinton had failed to protect american personnel in benghazi libya in 2012 when she was us secretary of state “in other words [blumenthal s] now admitting they could not have done something about benghazi trump said prompting loud reproaches from the crowd in fact the claim that clinton had something to answer for over the death of the us ambassador in benghazi was made by a newsweek journalist in an article that blumenthal had emailed to podesta as the author of the magazine piece promptly pointed out the conflation of the newsweek quotes and blumenthal appears to have been extracted by trump from an inaccurate account of the wikileaks documents reported by the russian online news outlet sputnik the botched attack on clinton and blumenthal could not backfire for trump given that he has already been accused by his democratic rival of being overly complimentary about the russian leader vladimir putin last friday the obama administration claimed that the wikileaks documents had been hacked from democrats email accounts by the russian government in an attempt to sway the us presidential election though trump avoided talking about the groping tape in wilkes barre at an earlier rally in ambridge pennsylvania he did renew his line of defence that his 2005 bragging about being able to kiss and grab the genitals of women was only “locker room talk one of his leading surrogates the former new york mayor rudy giuliani went further by turning the issue into a joke during a warm up speech at the wilkes barre rally giuliani made a quip about it during an attack on clinton he said “boy she is as phony as … i better not say as i have to be north carolina i might say it back in the locker room in his wilkes barre speech trump pressed all the familiar buttons that have by now become a mainstay of his insurrectionary campaign he promised to build a wall along the southern border and have the mexicans pay for it to bring jobs back to america from overseas and to cut taxes and government regulation the candidates braggadocio was clearly tailored to suit the tastes of his hardcore supporters most of whom dismissed concern about the nbc tape as so much political correctness the republican candidate also appeared to believe that his openly hostile stance towards clinton in the presidential debate in which he threatened her with jail interrupted her and jabbed his fingers at her multiple times and stood ominously behind her when she was talking had put the calamity of the groping scandal behind him so ebullient did he appear on stage on monday night that he even took a toddler from his parents arms and carried him on to the stage the crowd erupted in riotous cheering when the billionaire asked the child “do you want to go back to [your parents] or stay with donald trump? the toddler replied “trump but no matter how much he succeeded in firing up his base of dedicated trumpistas the reality tv star could not not erase the fact that outside the hothouse atmosphere of the mohegan sun arena his campaign remains in considerable trouble as a signal of the profound unease that his candidacy has generated among senior republicans the speaker of the house paul ryan effectively dumped trump telling congressional colleagues that he would neither defend his partys nominee nor campaign with him one of the first opinion polls to have been conducted since the groping bombshell gave clinton an 11 point lead nationally over her rival the nbc news / wall street journal survey put clinton on 46% to trumps 35% there was also evidence that clinton is solidifying her lead in key swing states such as ohio which has voted for the winning candidate in every presidential race since 1964 clinton travelled to ohio on monday to press home that advantage and later this week president obama will wade in on her behalf in cleveland and the state capital columbus it came as john mccain the 2008 republican nominee for us president was forced to publicly account for the decision to abandon trump “why now? the arizona senator was asked during a debate with his democratic challenger with the moderator noting the litany of incendiary remarks trump has made against mexicans muslims prisoners of war a disabled journalist a gold star military family and a hispanic judge alongside a decades long record of offensive comments about women earlier in his campaign trump also taunted mccain for having been a prisoner of war telling an audience he preferred “people that weren t captured “if someone wants to say something disparaging of me i understand that mccain said during arizonas senate debate “i spoke out strongly on several other issues where i thought mr trump was absolutely wrong i ve not been shy about it “when mr trump attacks women and demeans the women in our nation and our society that is a point where i just have to part company it is not pleasant for me to renounce the nominee of my party over the weekend mccain released a statement declaring it “impossible to continue to offer even conditional support to trump and said he and his wife cindy mccain will instead write in the name of “some good conservative republican who is qualified to be president on monday night mccain said this was likely to be the south carolina senator lindsey graham who dropped out of the presidential race in december last year “hes an old good friend of mine and a lot of people like him.,REAL
560,on feb 29 2012 mitt romney finally retook the lead in real clear politics average of polling of the republican nomination contest that year for the final time months of ups and downs and four years ago monday romney finally had a clear path to the nomination in the 2004 democratic and 2008 democratic and republican contests as well the person leading on feb 29 in the polling average went on to win his partys nomination even without the new cnn/orc poll released on monday the 2016 fields leading candidates are clearly identifiable donald trump and hillary clinton but the new poll also moves trump and clinton further away from the people they re leading on the democratic side clintons once shaky lead over sen bernie sanders of vermont looks much firmer even before her blow out victory in south carolina on saturday but on the republican side the shift since january has been truly amazing remember in the middle of january when cnn/orc last polled the republican party survey included rick santorum and mike huckabee it included jeb bush and carly fiorina and new jersey gov chris christie when those candidates dropped out their support had to go somewhere and the establishment has been banking on it going to anyone but trump trump leads at 49 percent his highest numbers in any poll tracked by real clear politics this cycle the number suggests that the theory that he had a ceiling of support that he could not never get to 50 percent was flawed with tuesdays numerous contests looming trump has the support of about half of his party in a field with five candidates and that consolidation theory is revealed as a consolation theory as we noted over the weekend if ohio gov john kasich were to drop out and every single one of his supporters were to migrate to sen marco rubio the senator from florida would go from trailing by 33 to trailing by 27 looking deeper into the polls we see two shifts from what we thought we knew about the race first trumps no longer just the candidate preferred by poorer less educated voters (though that was always a bit overplayed) his strength among college graduates has spiked since january second you can see very clearly how hes eaten into texas sen ted cruzs base of support among evangelicals and tea party supporters there are some reasonably high margins of error in there; we are talking about subsets of a subset of the full poll but a 40 point lead as trump enjoys over cruz with tea partiers is not one that falls into any gray area whats more republicans generally feel pretty okay with a trump nomination he has a much more enthusiastic base of support than rubio or cruz cnn notes that a quarter of republicans said they probably or definitely wouldn t support trump in november but also noted that about the same share of voters say that of rubio and cruz one of the stumbling blocks trump was expected to face as voting finally rolled around was that less partisan voters would gravitate toward a candidate they thought could not win in november who is that? why it is donald trump who 63 percent of republicans think has the best shot in a general election interestingly and with the critical caveat that general election polling this far out is still not very useful trump does worse against possible democratic opponents than rubio or cruz in cnns polling but thats an issue for another day once the nominations are actually settled of course if the past three cycles are any indicator they re all but settled already.,REAL

3947,sometimes it takes a wolf to catch a snakerudy giuliani has been making the media rounds over the last two days bragging that he knew about fbi director james comeys letter two days before it went publicthat means giuliani has been getting inside information from the supposedly non partisan federal bureau of investigation that he has likely been passing on to donald trump which means the fbi appears to be colluding with trumps campaign to sabotage hillary clintonand during an interview with wolf blitzer on cnn friday night giuliani was cornered over it because the only way he could not possibly get such information is if a current fbi agent is passing information to him personally or through someone else no i versus spoken to no current fbi agents giuliani claimed when asked by blitzer gosh in the last eight months nine months ten months certainly not about this then giuliani claimed that everything he has been hearing is just hearsay but that apparently has not stopped him from spewing the hearsay on fox news and elsewhere in an effort to smear hillary clinton so i versus had lots of conversations with them and they have told me a lot about the i guess the disagreement between the justice department on the one hand and the fbi on the other but it all comes from former fbi agents and it is all hearsay but thats hard to believe since giuliani claimed that he knew about comeys letter two days in advance and that letter was actually released it was not hearsayblitzer then hit giuliani with a statement written by democratic congressmen accusing him of obtaining leaked information from fbi agentsthe statement reads this morning rudy giuliani one of donald trumps closest and most vocal campaign advisers appeared on national television and confirmed that he had obtained leaked information about the fbis review of clinton related e mails several days before fbi director james comey senator his letter to congress last friday about this letter in fact mr giuliani went even further and bragged about the information that he had obtained stating did i hear about it? you re darn right i heard about it again the only way giuliani could not have heard about this is if a current fbi agent leaked the information to him or passed it to him through someone else either way the fbi has a serious breach that is being used to help donald trump thats not correct giuliani responded i versus had no conversations with anyone inside the fbi i have heard for the last four months a tremendous amount of information about the consternation within the fbi the fact that fbi agents were very unhappy about the way they were being treated by the justice department but none of it came from any current i haven t talked to a current fbi agent so giuliani just admitted that he is getting this information from former agents who are getting the information from current agentsblitzer actually got giuliani to claim that he didn t know that comey was going to release the information he did and that it came as a surprise but giuliani did an about face only seconds later and said it wasn t a surprise seriously blitzer did a great job of getting giuliani to tie himself in knotsthe former nyc mayor then repeated his alleged hearsay once again by claiming that he has heard from his sources that fbi agents are angry at the justice department for not indicting hillary clinton despite the fact that director comey recommended that charges were not warrantedgiuliani then claimed that he read articles about it somewhere but didn t specify where the articles came from and said hes not sure if they are trueso giuliani claims that he is talking to former fbi agents and that what he has heard is merely hearsay that he spreads anyway as if it is the truth and then he claims that he read this information in articles even though he doesn t know if what he is reading is the truth and he still repeats it to anyone within earshotand wolf blitzer drove a stake through the heart of giulianis bullshit by asking one question but let me ask you a question mayor if you don t know it is true why are you suggesting it? why are you going on national television talking about these issues if you don t know it is true? giuliani once again touted his fbi sources only to then be informed by blitzer that fbi agents sign a form agreeing to never reveal information about investigations and that they have a responsibility to not leak information to people like giulianiheres the video via youtube[ad3media campaign= 1302 ]the fbi should be thoroughly investigated by the justice department to find out who is leaking information to a private citizen who also happens to be a surrogate for a presidential candidate who will do anything to smear his opponent in an effort to win the election this is a major breach within the fbi and it definitely looks like the fbi is working with republicans to persecute hillary clinton people need to be fired for this and the first person to lose their job should be director comeyfeatured image via screen capture from embedded video.,FAKE

and at worst inevitably leads one down the road of violence and treachery more than a few retrograde elements accompany all this including the sympathetic portrayal of the fbi and an undercurrent of anti chinese chauvinism by the end of the season some of the fsociety “revolutionaries have set out a plan that would include an act of violent terrorism while others are speculating about the possibility of “undoing the effects of the hack and “putting everything back the way it was one has little reason to believe that any of this will turn out well with original select comments from original thread (whose opinions we endorse) solerso • 2 hours ago they end up condemning the entire notion of revolution itself taken at face value the show depicts “revolution as a cure worse than the disease one that at best is the product of misguided naiveté;

brussels airport on march 22 2016 the attacks on the airport and a subway killed 32 people and wounded more than 300 isis claims its fighters launched the attacks in the belgian capital my purpose here today is to assert in my judgment (isis) is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including yazidis christians and shiite muslims he said during a news conference at the state department kerry said that in 2014 isis trapped yazidis killed them enslaved thousands of yazidi women and girls selling them at auction raping them at will and destroying the communities in which they had lived for countless generations executed christians solely for their faith and also forced christian women and girls into slavery without our intervention it is clear that those people would have been slaughtered he said this is the first time that the united states has declared a genocide since darfur in 2004 the house of representatives on monday unanimously passed a resolution labeling the isis atrocities against christian groups in syria and iraq genocide a term the state department had been reluctant to use about the attacks and mass murders by the terror group the move aimed at ramping up pressure on the obama administration appears to have worked the measure was non binding but both republicans and democrats in the house joined together 393 0 to back a sense of congress saying the crimes committed against christians yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities in the region amount to war crimes and in some cases genocide republican rep jeff fortenberry whose nebraska district is home to the largest group of resettled yazidis in the us authored the resolution with california democratic rep anna eshoo during debate on monday fortenberry noted it was a rare instance of an issue that has risen above the petty and difficult differences we often work out on the floor of the house of representatives under a deadline set by congress the state department had until thursday to formally to decide whether it would issue a comprehensive genocide designation kerry though had previously alluded to the possibility that the actions of isis also know as isil were genocide isils campaign of terror against the innocent including the yazidi and christian minorities and its grotesque targeted acts of violence show all the warning signs of genocide kerry said in august 2014 for anyone who needed a wakeup call this is it fortenberry praised the state department for its decision thursday i commend secretary kerry and the state department for making this important designation the genocide against christians yazidis and others is not only a grave injustice to theses ancient faith communities it is an assault on human dignity and an attack on civilization itself he said the united states has now spoken with clarity and moral authority that it took so long for the administration to arrive at this conclusion in the face of unspeakable human suffering defies explanation rubio who until tuesday was a republican party presidential candidate said in a statement at long last the united states is no longer silent in the face of this evil but it would be travesty if we were to mistakenly take solace in this designation if the designation did not then yield some sort of action i am very happy to hear that (the us) will recognize the genocide of yezidi and christian minorities he told cnn in an email this is an important step to stop the suffering of the persecuted people under the control of the extremist islamic groups specially isis and this is also important for my community to trust the international community again because we were left in the hands of islamic state he called on the state department to push the un to establish an international criminal court case on genocide against the yazidis and christians in iraq and syria furthermore he said it is necessary to give the minorities more support to be sure that (these) crimes will not happen again an international center advocating against hate terrorism and anti semitism was one to join the chorus the simon wiesenthal center applauds secretary kerrys acknowledgement that christians and yazidis are targets of genocide the organization said in a statement we reiterate our call that the us put these two groups at the front of the line for consideration for immigration to our country and to redouble our efforts to destroy isis in defense of christians a group that has heavily lobbied for recognizing what is happening as genocide put out a statement from its president toufic baaklini idc extends our deepest gratitude to secretary kerry and to the obama administration for carefully reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the genocide against christians yazidis shia muslims and other religious minorities and for proclaiming the irrefutable truth that the crimes they have suffered constitute genocide baaklini said and the archbishop of washington cardinal donald wuerl put out a statement of appreciation for some time the world has witnessed the deliberate and organized effort by isis to eliminate christians from the middle east for the us government to call this savagery by its proper name genocide is a welcome step in what must now be a more committed effort at bringing peace and security to that beleaguered land wuerl said these words must now be translated into action.,REAL

obama continued pointing to another favorite right wing go to topic auto fatality rates previously conservatives were able to mindlessly point out that more people are killed by cars than guns unfortunately for them and fortunately for the rest of us regulations and laws have decreased the automobile fatality rate to beneath the level of gun violence the auto fatality rate has actually dropped precipitously drastically since i was a kid obama said asking rhetorically what is the cause of that the president informed rhude that thanks to numerous regulations lots of studies and a strong and continuing effort we have been able to reduce the number of people who die in cars no one took everyones cars away we simply arrived at the common sense decision to actually deal with the problem we are not allowed to do any of that when it comes to guns because if you propose anything it is suggested that we are trying to take away gun rights and impose martial law obama pointed out adding that we can t so much as study gun violence because republicans in congress have actually passed laws preventing this public health issue from being researched the notion is that by studying it the same way we do with traffic accidents somehow it is going to lead to everyones guns being confiscated obama pointed out i just came from a meeting today in the situation room in which i got people who we know have been on isil web sites living here in the united states us citizens and we are allowed to put them on the no fly list when it comes to airlines but because of the national rifle association i cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun the president told rhude this is somebody who is a known isil sympathizer and if he wants to walk in to a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as much as many weapons and ammo as he can nothings prohibiting him from doing that even though the fbi knows who that person is then he dropped the hammer so sir i just have to say respectfully that there is a way for us to have commonsense gun laws there is a way for us to make sure that lawful responsible gun owners like yourself are able to use them for sporting hunting protecting yourself but the only way we are going to do that is if we don t have a situation in which anything that is proposed is viewed as some tyrannical destruction of the second amendment and thats how the issue too often gets framedwhile it is unlikely that rhude or any other right wingers who heard the presidents words learned a single thing one thing is for certain it is north carolina to see barack obama standing up for himselfwatch it yourself below featured image via video screen captures.,FAKE

700,(cnn) hillary clintons surprise loss in michigan raises an urgent question for her campaign what went wrong? in the days ahead of the primary clinton repeatedly hammered sanders over his 2009 vote against a bailout for the us auto industry calculating that the line of attack would resonate in a state thats home to the countrys largest car manufacturers but by tuesday night some michigan democrats aligned with clintons campaign said privately they think that strategy did not work as they intended cnn exit polls showed that sanders outperformed clinton among voters who are very worried about the us economy 56% to 40% among voters who believe international trade takes away american jobs sanders also led clinton 56% to 43% a sign that sanders populist economic message resonated in michigan in another troubling sign for the clinton campaign among voters who said their most important priority in a presidential candidate is that they are honest and trustworthy sanders overwhelmingly outperformed clinton 80% to 19% some supporters pointed to the fact that in contrast to sanders clinton had only campaigned in detroit flint and grand rapids after campaigning tirelessly in nevada and south carolina clintons schedule in michigan seemed less packed the hand wringing inside the clinton circle also included the concern that perhaps the campaign had lost sight of winning the democratic nomination and started looking ahead at the general election too soon they didn t take sanders for granted as much as voters said one top democrat close to the campaign clinton told supporters on monday that the sooner i could not become your nominee the more i could not begin to turn my attention to the republicans clintons aides seemed to anticipate the potential of a michigan loss a memo last week from clinton campaign manager robby mook noted even if sen sanders were able to eke out a victory (in michigan) we would still net more delegates in mississippi which holds its election on the same night indeed clinton actually won more delegates than sanders on tuesday according to a cnn estimate picking up 84 to sanders 67 she now has 1 234 of the 2 383 delegates needed to win the nomination that figure includes super delegates party officials and office holders who have said they will back her as it began to dawn on the clinton campaign that the michigan contest would be much tighter than it had anticipated jennifer palmieri clintons communication director said that demographics were partly to blame michigan looks a lot like states that sen sanders does well in the democratic vote is only about 75% white that is always coming in at a disadvantage to us palmieri told reporters tuesday night in ohio palmieri added that at the end of the day the campaign still felt confident she is going to be the nominee sanders performance in michigan gives the senators campaign a fresh boost of optimism particularly after losing by big margins to clinton in a state like south carolina where he had made aggressive outreach to the african american community one of his main challenges is to show that he can win over a more diverse electorate clintons struggles in michigan will be particularly worrisome as the campaign aims to win neighboring ohio on march 15 but on tuesday night palmieri denied that the tightness in michigan indicates potential problems for clinton in ohio arguing that clintons message on jobs the auto bailout and the republican party can deliver them the buckeye state we think that she came into michigan with a very strong economic agenda and message about how she would create jobs and put manufacturing sector around clean energy also how she would help create small businesses very future oriented palmieri said we don t think senator sanders offered that and we think that that will be effective in ohio sanders acknowledged that the michigan vote was close but thanked voters for repudiating polls that indicated clinton had stronger support in the state what tonight means is that the bernie sanders campaign the peoples revolution that we are talking about the political revolution that we are talking about is strong in every part of the country sanders said and frankly we believe our strongest areas are yet to happen.,REAL

730,by rmuse 10 03 am the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries *the following is an opinion column by r muse* for almost all secular humanists organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation throughout recorded history the catholic church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents but any humans it comes in contact with that lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the 21st century and in america like the rest of the earth the catholics number one focus has been on controlling women apparently the catholic church in massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population on friday the boston globe reported that the archdiocese of boston dropped about a million dollars in a last ditch effort to exert church control over massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use other reports reveal that the tax exempt political spending is meant to help defeat a massachusetts ballot measure question 4 question 4 simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over 21 and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of massachusetts question 4 contains no references to the catholic or any other church and makes no claim of trying to “ impact ministries a spokesman for the boston archdiocese terrence donilon made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the catholic churchs political donation to the campaign against massachusetts version of legalized recreational marijuana saying “ it reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities it is a recognition that if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries seriously that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use tax free congregants donations to interfere in an election ever offered nowhere in massachusetts or any states decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned much less affected by the outcome of an election catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis and despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes the church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes and the usccb will still attempt to control and dominate all american women no reefer decriminalization will impact the catholic ministry but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests and relieve americas over burdened judicial system now the catholics claim that people using cannabis legally whether they inhale or eat it will have “ significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries that is an odd assertion on yet another point; surely part of “catholic ministries is teaching according to their gods word in the christian bible it is nearly certain that every catholic priest on the planet including those in massachusetts are aware of gods word in genesis where in chapter 2 verse 9 the catholics “ almighty god said “ out of the ground the lord god caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food and he continues in verses 15 17 “ then the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to cultivate it and keep it the lord god commanded the man saying “from any tree of the garden you may eat freely but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities 10 000 years ago there is no record of reefer ever being confused with “ the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; weed is not and will not affect the catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past two thousand years the catholic church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal in a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with tax exempt money an advocate and spokesman for the yes on question 4 jim borghesani said “ the archdiocese has come up with a position that frankly we think is based on unfounded assumptions and june science what i think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that (marijuana) prohibition has done to people of color to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because they ve been arrested one wonders if part of the boston archdioceses ministry entails increasing the number of americans mainly americans of color senator to prison for possessing or using a plant that “ god caused to grow and was “ pleasing to the sight and good to eat obviously that is the case and according to a new set of data keeping marijuana illegal means keeping americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every 25 seconds of every day of the year why is the catholic church so interested in perpetuating the failed “war on drugs in general and the criminalization of marijuana in particular? as noted by michael stone over at patheos what the massachusetts catholics and mormons are actually helping to sustain is “ in reality a war on poor people and people of color mr stone really nails it when he said that by spending tax exempt donations on a political agenda to “ defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana; the catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed war on drugs and the new jim crow the archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy besides implicit racism because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using tax exempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is “ morally indefensible mormons are also busy instructing lds members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private mormon lives or their lds ministry but they allegedly don t condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites; at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned the massachusetts catholics may not be violating the law by “ acting as an anti marijuana super pac but they are using tax exempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other americans lives; the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of american society however if the church is so flush with money; why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the churchs pedophile priests? or dog forbid use that tax exempt donors money to help the people of massachusetts in need the catholic church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents and that is down to frightened people needing a daddy figure in the church to tell them what is right what is wrong and how to stay out of the proverbial hell; that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity but for people that are not “ in the church it is an affront to use donated tax exempt money to impact (read control) their private lives the only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like question 4 will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregations hard earned money this is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and american citizen except donald trump it is “ morally obnoxious that the archdiocese is using the congregations donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with tax exempt funds wrung out of hardworking americans many of whom use recreational cannabis h/t patheos.,FAKE

heading into the first contests of the 2016 campaign season cruz tops republican party polls in iowa billionaire donald trump is on top in new hampshire and nationally and democrat hillary clinton hopes to quell a stronger than expected challenge in both states from sen bernie sanders but with many voters only now seriously sizing up the race for the first time polls are sure to shift and only the results in the early voting states themselves will answer some of the burning questions that have built up over the past year and clinton faces a nervous run in to iowa and new hampshire because any early losses to sanders could not awaken the ghosts of 2008 when voters blocked her inevitable candidacy here is a guide to the state of play in the early states and the lowdown on which candidacies are thriving and which could not fade before the later sweep of southern and larger states that could not decide the nomination iowa looks like cruz country 27 days before caucus goers traipse through a chilly night to churches sports clubs and school gyms to select a nominee he has consolidated two crucial blocs of the states republican party coalition evangelical and tea party voters and victory in iowa would leave the well financed cruz strongly positioned for the southern state delegate harvest to come once a long shot cruz has prospered from tight self discipline on the stump an authentic conservative message and a reputation for throwing wrenches in the works in washington that antagonize party elites but delight the restive grass roots he had a very narrow window now he has got one of the best shots to win it said republican strategist ford o connell but voters are still making up their minds amid a torrent of attack ads and candidate bus tours town hall meetings and rallies i like carly (fiorina) i like rubio i don t like some of things trump says but i like some of things he says that need to be said said iowa voter marge delzell 75 of sioux city we were originally for carson but i don t know that he can beat hillary she said underlining the desire of many voters for a slayer of the likely democratic nominee the hawkeye state is also a big test for trump at first blush the billionaire real estate moguls brand of secular rude nasty politics seems a poor fit for a state where conservatives pride civility faith and ideological purity but his experience inside business and outside politics is connecting with republicans who despair at their partys leadership some 39% of republican party voters in the register poll said they were looking for a government outsider who has handled complex issues and managed teams it is been easy to forget during his long reign atop the polls but iowa will be the first election in which trump has ever stood so the caucuses will help answer a fundamental 2016 question will his band of angry followers who disdain the political system actually show up and vote? and how will trump respond if he loses? would defeat undercut the rationale of his campaign that he is a perpetual winner and melt his white house hopes before he leaves the snows of iowa for the snows of new hampshire? amid reports that he has begun intensively building a traditional get out the vote operation in iowa and elsewhere trump seems to understand the stakes in the early voting states and claims he will start spending 2 dollars million per week don t sit back and say oh trump is going to do well the more we can win by you know the more power we have in a sense because it is like a mandate but you have got to go out and vote he told supporters in south carolina last week rubio who is trying to prove he can win over conservatives last week shipped in south carolina rep trey gowdy a hero to the right after his october interrogation of clinton over benghazi the senators work on immigration has cost him some support with the right and gowdys backing is designed to give him a character witness for rubios own patriotic aspirational promise to renew the american dream it is ok to be hopeful as you are delivering the message of conservativism you don t have to be angry and you don t have to be upset; you can be hopeful gowdy said at a town hall meeting in newton iowa as evangelical voters go for cruz and carson iowa could not be where we say goodbye to long shots such as 2012 caucuses winner rick santorum and 2008 victor mike huckabee who were unable to build support there this time around among democrats in iowa clinton is leading atop a humming state political network she built after learning the lessons of a third place finish in 2008 troubles here could not raise questions about her campaign and whether she can connect with the democratic partys liberal wing her team is taking nothing for granted since she trails sanders in the next contest in new hampshire however victory in iowa twinned with a likely rout of sanders in south carolina could not all but guarantee her the nomination the stakes are very high for her here she has got to win if she does fine if she doesn t then it becomes a much different game in new hampshire said david yepsen a veteran journalist who covered the caucuses for the des moines register for more than three decades it is really sanders only hope to get something going is to upend her here the february 9 new hampshire primary could not spread carnage through the ranks of moderate and establishment republicans but there is definitely hope for at least one of the slumbering big beasts of the republican party to make a march thats because granite state voters have an independent streak and often pride themselves in anointing an alternative to the winner in iowa and are more fixated on economic and national security issues than the social themes that dominate the caucuses in theory that could not boost candidates who can appeal to a more centrist audience such as bush christie kasich and those who can straddle both conservative and moderate camps such as rubio but trump a huge disruptive force has trashed assumptions in new hampshire and the proliferation of candidates battling for the same audience in the bloated republican field has also made it so far impossible for one to emerge as the true alternative to the real estate mogul and to catch him in the polls i don t like trump i wish he wasn t the front runner i hope somebody anybody else would knock him out said republican voter peter smiglis from windham new hampshire smiglis sees bush as too weak and thinks rubio and christie have waffled on illegal immigration the issue that has fired up the conservative base a boston herald franklin pierce university poll in mid december showed trump leading at 26% and reveals the demolition derby unfolding in his wake with rubio and cruz at 12% christie at 11% bush at 10% and kasich 2 points back bush is fighting for his life living out of a suitcase in the state relocating most of his campaign staff to new hampshire and unleashing a newly aggressive stump persona and multimillion dollar ad barrage against trump and his rivals for the establishment lane for christie showing signs of life and kasich new hampshire also represents a make or break moment rubio could not be on the skids meanwhile if he bombs in iowa and can t make a march in new hampshire trump though would do well to take nothing for granted granite state voters are notorious for making up their minds late i ll decide probably when i walk into the voting booth said voter heidi milbrand at a recent christie event in new london state republican party official ray tweedie meanwhile says voters are drilling into the weeds on issues to separate the candidates and predicts a traumatic tuesday february 9 for a number of top contenders i think there will be a massive winnowing down of the field come wednesday morning he said democrats also face a difficult choice new hampshire lies next to the home patch of sanders in vermont and its mainly white liberal and more elderly democrats mirror the vermont senators coalition but the state also made both bill and hillary clinton comeback kids in 1992 and 2008 and the former first couple maintain a deep political network there sanders has consistently led clinton but should she mount a come from behind win the obituaries will be rolled out for his 2016 campaign south carolina has often been the tie breaker settling the fight between iowa and new hampshire republican voters in the palmetto state have backed the eventual nominee in every primary race since 1980 with the exception of 2012 when newt gingrich won there is a sense here that people want to get that reputation back said david woodard a political science professor at clemson university of the february 20 primary the most recent winthrop university poll shows trump out front with 24% and ted cruz with 16% and carson coming in third with 14% support about likely republican party voters but there is also some good news for rubio at 11% and bush with 9% support compared with his roughly 3 or 4% backing nationally and rubios endorsement from gowdy who represents voter rich greenville in the upstate could not be significant but gingrichs 2012 win which came after consecutive losses demonstrated how debate performances and an anti elite message can resonate with voters culturally cruz a texan who wears black ostrich cowboy boots and quotes the bible with ease might be the best fit in south carolina where nearly 60% of likely republican party voters described themselves as evangelical or born again in a recent winthrop poll rick vasso 61 originally favored carson but now thinks he lacks the leadership qualities needed of a president he has narrowed his choice down to a candidate he initially thought was too conservative to win the nomination but he has since seen rise steadily in the polls if the primary were tomorrow i would vote for ted cruz vasso of greenville said he has a good chance to beat hillary clinton but rubio wouldn t be a bad second choice vasso said though he prefers cruzs stance on illegal immigration they would be a great one two punch vasso said if one wins then the other is on the ticket as the vice presidential pick that could not set up the party for 16 years as for the democrats the test of clintons southern firewall begins here roughly half of the voters in the february 27 primary will be african american and clinton has outpaced sanders by wide margins among that demographic a recent fox news poll shows her with 80% backing among african americans to sanders 11% a strong showing by sanders could not upend clintons strategy and set up a tougher fight in the southern primaries to come coming out of south carolina where 50 delegates are at stake the remaining candidates face a test of organization in nevada and a test of their conservative credentials in a slew of mostly southern states on march 1 when nearly 600 delegates will be up for grabs the significance of the republican party nevada caucuses the first in the west contest on february 23 depends greatly on results of the other previous contests as with other caucus contests polling has been patchy the latest cnn/orc poll for nevada in october had trump on 38% with a double figure lead over carson before his nationwide poll slump if there is any candidate who might have an edge in nevada it is rubio the florida senator lived in las vegas until middle school and has been heavily courting mormons as a child rubio and his family belonged to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints for about three years before returning to catholicism cruz is also fighting for the support of mormons who could not make up a quarter of the republican party electorate nevada where 30 proportionally allocated delegates at stake could not offer the morale boost of a victory for rubio or another win for cruz clinton who won nevada in 2008 is heavily favored in the february 20 democratic caucuses thanks to her popularity among latino voters still there is no bigger day than super duper tuesday when 13 states will hold contests the most for a single day clinton is betting that a sweep of southern states alabama arkansas georgia tennessee texas and virginia will propel her to the nomination sanders will likely win his home state and do well in massachusetts and states with similar demographics on the republican party side cruz has a similar strategy to clintons betting that evangelical voters in states such as georgia and arkansas will give him a boost what happens in sec primary is dependent on what happens in february is it a big day sure a lot of delegates at stake they are proportional states said justin putnam who runs the blog frontloadinghq it is a sequential process and we will see who is viable and left standing while contests in deep red states will dominate states such as virginia vermont and massachusetts also hold contests the winner of those states could not lay claim to the establishment title arguing that wins there prove electability in the general election but because of the fact that many states award their delegates on a proportional even the sec primary may not crown a nominee so though a candidate such as cruz looks strong he may still not clinch the nomination if it is cruz wins cruz wins cruz wins thats a big momentum it will look and sound powerful despite the delegate numbers cruz is clearly making it his strategy to win in the south and it is smart from a perception standpoint said angie maxwell an assistant professor at the university of arkansas who writes about politics in the south in terms of delegate counts it doesn t do as much as it would have done had they been winner take all primaries but the headlines could not be a game changer said maxwell.,REAL

515,hillary clinton and bernie sanders clashed sharply thursday over who is more progressive at a debate that saw the former secretary of state ratcheting up her criticism of the vermont senator on several fronts even accusing him of engineering an “artful smear with suggestions she could not be “bought by donors the debate the first since the iowa caucuses and last before next weeks critical new hampshire primary was by far the most confrontational of the democratic primary race clinton coming off a narrow iowa win and trying to shrink sanders huge lead in granite state polls stayed on offense for most of the night she slammed sanders campaign promises as too costly while standing firm in claiming shes a true “progressive despite sanders comments to the contrary sanders meanwhile dug in as he questioned whether clinton really “walks the walk of the progressive cause and described her as the candidate of the “establishment “secretary clinton does represent the establishment i represent i hope ordinary americans he said stressing that he unlike clinton doesn t enjoy super pac backing and is funded in large part by small dollar donations the verbal jabs flew quickly and clinton left few allegations unchallenged visibly fed up with a campaign trail narrative that has painted her as the candidate of wall street she rebutted sanders “establishment charge by questioning whether someone running to be the first female president can carry that label the most heated moment at the msnbc hosted debate in durham nh came when clinton told sanders she rejects the suggestion that anyone who takes donations or speaking fees from interest groups can be bought “enough is enough clinton said telling sanders the “attacks by insinuation are not “worthy of him clinton said if sanders has something to allege “say it directly but “you will not find that i ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that i ever received she closed “i think it is time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks that line earned a groan from sanders and some boos from the audience sanders went on to link wall street deregulation with billions spent on lobbying and campaign contributions “some people think yeah that had some influence he said clinton meanwhile described herself as a “progressive who gets things done and ripped sanders for suggesting clinton cannot be a “moderate and a “progressive at the same time she teased sanders as being the “self proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism and said she doesn t know anyone who fits his definition the fireworks underscored the tight state of the race going into new hampshires contest next tuesday clinton arrived on the debate stage clearly ready to rebut sanders proposals and accusations notably his oft repeated criticism that she as senator erred by voting to authorize the use of force in iraq “a vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat isis she countered yet as clinton stressed her secretary of state experience and sanders said that factor is “not arguable the vermont senator noted experience is not the only point “judgment is he said again pointing to the 2002 iraq vote “one of us voted the right way and one of us didn t as she has at prior debates clinton also challenged the senators proposals for free college and universal health care “the numbers just don t add up clinton said she questioned how the country could not for instance pay for free tuition at public colleges as sanders wants and accused him of wanting to effectively scrap obamacare a charge he denied sanders defended his plans particularly for universal health care “i do believe we should have health care for all he said the former secretary of state met the vermont senator on stage in durham nh after eking out a narrow victory in mondays caucuses while her campaign celebrated the win sanders strong showing in the state nevertheless has helped boost his fundraising and he heads into new hampshire with a steady double digit lead in the polls there remains an ongoing dispute however over the iowa results the des moines register editorial board earlier thursday called for an audit of the democratic caucus results citing problems and confusion at polling sites asked at thursdays debate about the editorial sanders said “i agree with the des moines register he said after speaking with precinct captains the campaign believes they may have “at least two more delegates yet sanders who has complained how some local delegates were allocated based on coin tosses also said they should not “blow this out of proportion “ “this is not the biggest deal in the world sanders said asked if she d participate in an audit clinton said “whatever they decide to do thats fine clinton separately said shes 100 percent confident nothing will come of the fbi probe into her personal email use as secretary of state the democratic debate on thursday was the first to feature clinton and sanders one on one with former maryland gov martin o malley now out of the race following his distant third showing in iowa the debate was one of four added to the calendar earlier this week after the democratic national committee and the two campaigns agreed to the terms the party had come under criticism for its sparse schedule and was accused of trying to shield clinton from

territory trump has proved so unpopular among some republican voters minorities and women that deep red territory is perhaps in play states such as arizona utah and georgia which haven t voted democrat in decades could not be vulnerable in the winner take all electoral college system and clinton has superior fundraising and a vastly more organised network of campaign offices her campaign is at least testing the waters on friday clinton began airing tv ads in arizona where mitt romney beat barack obama by nearly 10 points clintons husband is the only democrat to have won the state in a presidential election since 1952 her campaign is also spending money in nebraska one of two states that splits electoral college votes and therefore offers clinton a chance to peel off electors from

clever feints to trick trump is not clear some inside clintons brooklyn headquarters are reportedly cheering that moves into republican heartlands appear to have trump spending time and money in

their popularity on friends “this ain t over man this is not over joe biden warned at a rally for clinton in cleveland on thursday where one supporter confessed he was actually planning to vote trump but came along because he just liked the vice president the scepticism of many independent voters may also help explain the decision by clintons communications director jennifer palmieri to shield the candidate from the rough and tumble of open press conferences where generally risks are high and rewards low clintons campaign has expressed frustration with the questions of trustworthiness particularly over her private emails system that appear to reinforce a reputation of favoritism and privilege built up by the clintons aides also complain that she does not get the recognition she deserves for developing many more new policy ideas than most candidates “people criticise me for having so many plans clinton told a lukewarm audience of military veterans in cincinnati on wednesday

756,americans tend to assume that polarization is bad for democracy it is supposed to undermine compromise and contribute to gridlock it is furthermore thought to be linked to growing inequality but when we talk about polarization we are usually talking about congress and political elites ordinary citizens show very little polarization in a new article we argue that this lack of polarization among the public isn t necessarily a good thing indeed it might be a sign of serious democratic failure why does polarization decrease when there is more economic inequality? first take a look at this puzzling graph if we look at advanced democracies we find that income inequality has a negative relationship with polarization (which we measure as the share of the population who think of themselves as being non centrist on a scale of left to right) in general as inequality increases polarization decreases (and vice versa) this is surprising when income inequality is higher we would expect people to disagree more about issues such as government spending and redistribution (which we know are closely associated with whether people view themselves as being on the left or on the right) looking at the data more closely shows that the median member of the public tends to be further to the right when income is more unequal again this is unexpected because the distribution of income favors the rich everywhere the mean income is higher than the median (it is pulled up by those with very high incomes) if the majority are well informed and self interested you would expect them to want more redistribution when inequality rises just the opposite is true why? we think it is because most people don t examine public policies closely and so drift to the center by default we argue that the answer to these puzzles involves information people are often not well informed about politics and they few have reason to be public policies affect large numbers of people but as individuals we don t have much power to change these policies so why spend valuable time acquiring information about them? as it turns out this simple fact (sometimes called “rational ignorance) has implications for polarization the reason is that uninformed voters tend to place themselves in the center of the political space which they see as “safe compared to more extreme options imagine that a voter can pick a left center or right party but doesn t have enough information to know which has the best economic policy given her interests she just assumes that there is an equal chance that each of these parties has the best policy the best strategy (if she doesn t have much information) is to pick the center party since it may actually have the best policy and even it doesn t its policy is more likely to be closer to the best policy than either of the other two because it is located between them (for a step by step derivation see the original paper) this logic also applies to ideological self placement and we refer to it as the centrist bias the more people know the less centrist they become the centrist bias dissipates as people acquire information those whose interests would dispose them to identify with the center will still do so but those who we might expect to identify with the left or the right will move away from the center information breeds polarization so one way to think about why some countries have more non centrist voters is to ask how and why voters acquire political information most people get information through groups and networks like unions families or co workers we argue that most people get information through the groups and networks they belong to one such group is unions although unions like other formal groups have declined in importance in most societies unions often expose their members to political messages and they also sometimes engage their members in political discussion when discussion is involved say when a union official brings up political issues around the workplace lunch table it pushes people to look for information from papers tv the internet and so on this logic also applies to political discussion in social networks of family friends neighbors and co workers people are more likely to acquire political information when others around them care about such information and are evaluating them in part based on whether they seem well informed needless to say it is easier for well educated people to acquire political information so educated people tend to respond more effectively to such social incentives so who tends to be well informed? this has partisan implications those with higher incomes tend to have better education and be better integrated into social networks with a lot of political discussion these people are the natural constituents of center right parties which means that the centrist bias is less pronounced for the right yet the extent to which this is true varies across time and space many different factors union membership membership in social networks with political discussion and education are associated with higher levels of information and therefore also with ideological polarization in countries with strong unions the centrist and right biases are less pronounced the same is true in countries with good public education systems and more pervasive informal discussion networks the figure below shows the relationship between the frequency of political discussion in social networks and ideological polarization the political discussion taking place at parisian street cafes really does matter and so does a blog like this! we should not be surprised some public policies can lead to more or less general knowledge and public discussion and therefore whether there is an informed left this implies that countries with certain institutions and policies strong unions heavy investment in public education and extensive social networks end up with more politically informed electorates which are also more ideologically polarized and left leaning than countries where these institutions are less well developed at the same time unions public education and network integration promote income equality for reasons that are well understood in economics together this provides a plausible explanation for the pattern showed in our first graph where there is a negative relationship between inequality and polarization because governments of the left and right affect the income distribution though public policies most obviously through redistribution and public education these relationships may be self reinforcing producing distinct “varieties of democracies from this perspective polarization may in fact be a sign of a well functioning democracy one that has well informed electorates and governments that support the majoritys interests in pushing back against rising inequality torben iversen is the harold hitchings burbank professor of political economy in the department of government at harvard university david soskice is a professor in the department of government at the london school of economics.,REAL

346,los angeles (cnn) hillary clinton is on the cusp of declaring victory as the democratic nominee after a long and protracted battle with bernie sanders but she has one very serious problem the vermont senator isn t giving up clinton and her husband have barnstormed across california at a furious pace in recent days seeking to avoid yet another humiliating defeat by sanders on the same night she should easily win the delegates needed to go past the 2 383 march and clinch the nomination i m very proud of the campaign we are running here and i believe on tuesday i will have decisively won the popular vote and i will have decisively won the pledged delegate majority clinton said on cnns state of the union by all objective measures she and her allies argue that the race is over the delegate math the money the millions of votes in her column all point to her inevitability as the nominee sanders however shows no sign that he is preparing to exit the stage facing a strong possibility that he could not carry in california he vowed in no uncertain terms this weekend to lead his movement on to the convention in philadelphia at a news conference in las little tokyo saturday he railed against the press and the news networks for counting superdelegates in their tallies it is extremely unlikely that secretary clinton will have the requisite number of pledged delegates to claim victory on tuesday night sanders said at the end of the nominating process no candidate will have enough pledged delegates to call the campaign a victory that will be dependent upon superdelegates in other words the democratic national convention will be a contested convention the first female presidential nominee of a major political party could not find herself shadowed by sanders intensive campaign to sway hundreds of superdelegates despite winning fewer contests and votes some democrats worry that would put the democratic party at a disadvantage by making it harder for clinton to unify the party and turn her full attention to donald trump from a pure mathematical perspective the democratic primary in puerto rico sunday leaves clinton on the verge of becoming the nominee 29 delegates shy of the magic number according to cnn estimates on tuesday 694 delegates will be at stake in the democratic contests including 475 in california alone but clinton is likely to win many of them while the math is not on his side sanders showed defiance and determination as he swept through california all weekend charging trump with trying to divide the country and clinton with advocating for small incremental changes when we want to transform this nation a robust showing tuesday could not give sanders a strong closing argument in his pitch to superdelegates speaking for more than an hour saturday night outside the los angeles memorial coliseum as the flame of the olympic torch flickered brightly above him he urged his followers to dismiss those who claim his path is impossible if we can win and win big here in california and in the other states and in washington dc we are going to go into the democratic convention with enormous momentum sanders told thousands of young supporters many of whom were wearing bernie or bust buttons with your help i believe we will come out with the nomination for sanders the long democratic primary is coming to an end amid feelings of astonishment and regret when he launched his presidential bid a year ago advisers say winning wasn t his chief goal he wanted to make sure clinton had a competitive race and that he has done in spades while advisers say he is serious about taking the primary fight to the democratic convention he also is mindful of keeping his pledge to keep trump from winning the presidency he has yet to reconcile those competing forces aides say but that rests at the heart of what he decides to do next sanders refuses to say what his goal would be if he does not win the nomination he will not even engage on those kinds of questions at this point in the process advisers say he is intent on trying to change the democratic nominating process particularly the superdelegate system and the series of closed primaries in states across the country but that could not be a tall order considering he just joined the party to run for president while this week will almost certainly decide the race sanders supporters insist that it will result in nothing more than a mathematical muddle whatever the networks decide to do in terms of calling the race sanders adviser tad devine said i don t think thats going to affect things the networks or the press can characterize what happens in any way they like you guys have a right to do that and so do we he said sanders argument for continuing on devine said is pretty straightforward that the delegates that have been elected by voters no one has enough of them to claim the nomination of the party so if you re going to win the nomination of the party you re going to win it with superdelegates and even the democratic national committee officially their spokesperson is out on the record saying that superdelegates votes should not officially be counted until the convention itself devine said sanders advisers also note that regardless of the results on tuesday night when voters go to the polls in california montana new jersey new mexico north dakota and south dakota the vermont senator intends to compete in washington dc on june 14 when it holds the final contest of the primary season they believe they have a strong case to make to superdelegates that sanders has gained strength over the course of the primary process while clintons candidacy has weakened they note that while clinton for example dominated in large states with diverse populations early in the process polls show sanders leading clinton among young minority voters in california by a wide margin beyond that sanders has continued to pound the argument that potential general election matchups show that he would be a stronger candidate against trump if the democratic leadership wants a campaign that will not only retain the white house and regain the senate and win governors chairs all over this country we are that campaign sanders said at a rally in san diego sunday night clinton has pointed out that in 2008 she was in sanders position in second place after a hard fought campaign against barack obama by some standards i actually led a little bit in the popular vote but i fell a little short in the pledged delegates she said on state of the union so i had a decision to make a lot of my supporters said hey lets keep going lets make sure that we go to the convention i said no i ran to become president because i have deep values and beliefs about what should be done in our country while sanders next moves are difficult to predict the bigger obstacle for clinton may be the fervency of his supporters particularly those who constitute the contingent who call themselves bernie or bust a quinnipiac poll earlier this month found that a quarter of sanders supporters nationally said they would not support clinton in a general election against trump while 75% said they would the clinton resistant contingent of sanders supporters was even higher in california in the recent usc dornsife/la times poll in that survey which may have prompted clinton to ramp up her campaign schedule here sanders led clinton 44 percent to 43 percent among registered voters (the vermont senator led her by double digits among voters who decline to state a party) among voters who are supporting sanders in the primary only 65% said they would support clinton in november those die hard sanders fans were out in force at his events in los angeles this weekend in interviews many said they either planned to either write in sanders in november or vote for the green party ticket i ve been watching the clintons for a very long time and i think there are some serious integrity issues and some character flaws i ll say to be north carolina which bernie doesn t have hes been consistent for 40 years and thats something i have to respect said danny garcia a 36 year old business consultant who said he has been a libertarian republican for most of his life before supporting sanders i m bernie or bust there is no hillary on my agenda said garcia who was signing up volunteers to go to philadelphia during sanders rally saturday night shes using her usual tactics which are to manipulate the populace discourage voters stop people from getting out and trying to control the media narrative which shes been pretty good at courtney wold a 25 year old filmmaker from los angeles said though she likes and respects clinton she plans to vote for green party candidate jill stein in november if sanders does not clinch the nomination the first rally he had me in tears along with everyone that was around us we were all collectively crying about how profound the message was wold said as she waited for sanders to speak at the coliseum this weekend my generation not speaking for the generation entirely but for me specifically i feel sort of disenfranchised i went to school; i got a college degree and then i left with a huge amount of debt i ve sort of come to terms with the fact that i ll never own a home wold said but i don t want that for my children and bernies the only one who truly spoke to that we like hillary we think shes done a lot for women and i think thats great but i m not voting based on my gender i m voting based on a platform many sanders backers recoil at the notion that he should bow out tuesday once clinton has mathematically clinched the nomination with a combination of pledged delegates and superdelegates they will be with him they say all the way through philadelphia and beyond absolutely he should stay and fight said gary frazier a leader of the group called black men for bernie whether he will or not that remains to be seen but you cannot start a political revolution that exposes the corruption in the political system and then expect us to get behind that same political system.,REAL

shame! shame! while wasserman schultz was speaking sanders tried to quell some of his dissatisfied supporters at a rally before his expected speech monday we have got to elect hillary clinton and tim kaine sanders said which prompted some attendees to shout him down wasserman schultz announced sunday she is stepping down as chairwoman of the dnc at the end of the partys convention the drama reinforced concerns about democratic party unity former sanders campaign manager jeff weaver tried to show a unified democratic party on monday the morning after wasserman schultz announced her resignation this happened we knew it happened then now is the time to go forward weaver told cnns chris cuomo on new day on monday now is the time to elect hillary clinton and defeat donald trump wasserman schultz talked with both president barack obama and clinton before making announcing her upcoming resignation a democratic source said going forward the best way for me to accomplish those goals [which include electing clinton president] is to step down as party chair at the end of this convention wasserman schultz said in the statement as party chair this week i will open and close the convention and i will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for democrats but for all americans she said dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile will serve as interim chair through the election she had been a cnn political commentator but cnn and brazile have mutually agreed to suspend their contract effective immediately although she will remain on air during the convention week in an unpaid capacity cnn said cnn will revisit the contract once brazile concludes her role separately a democratic operative said hispanic leaders close to clinton and her high command were discussing housing secretary julian castro as a possible successor to wasserman schultz at the dnc helm among a number of other candidates whose name are being mentioned chants of debbie is done!

1273,it was the rise of the davos class that sealed americas fate hillary clintons embrace of neoliberalism was disastrous the only answer now is to take on the billionaires by naomi klein november 10 2016 information clearing house the guardian they will blame james comey and the fbi they will blame voter suppression and racism they will blame bernie or bust and misogyny they will blame third parties and independent candidates they will blame the corporate media for giving him the platform social media for being a bullhorn and wikileaks for airing the laundry but this leaves out the force most responsible for creating the nightmare in which we now find ourselves wide awake neoliberalism that worldview  fully embodied by hillary clinton and her machine  is no match for trump style extremism the decision to run one against the other is what sealed our fate if we learn nothing else can we please learn from that mistake? here is what we need to understand a hell of a lot of people are in pain under neoliberal policies of deregulation privatisation austerity and corporate trade their living standards have declined precipitously they have lost jobs they have lost pensions they have lost much of the safety net that used to make these losses less frightening they see a future for their kids even worse than their precarious present at the same time they have witnessed the rise of the davos class a hyper connected network of banking and tech billionaires elected leaders who are awfully cosy with those interests and hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous success is a party to which they were not invited and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness for the people who saw security and status as their birthright  and that means white men most of all  these losses are unbearable donald trump speaks directly to that pain the brexit campaign spoke to that pain so do all of the rising far right parties in europe they answer it with nostalgic nationalism and anger at remote economic bureaucracies  whether washington the north american free trade agreement the world trade organisation or the eu and of course they answer it by bashing immigrants and people of colour vilifying muslims and degrading women elite neoliberalism has nothing to offer that pain because neoliberalism unleashed the davos class people such as hillary and bill clinton are the toast of the davos party in truth they threw the party trumps message was all is hell clinton answered all is well but its not well  far from it neo fascist responses to rampant insecurity and inequality are not going to go away but what we know from the 1930s is that what it takes to do battle with fascism is a real left a good chunk of trumps support could not be peeled away if there were a genuine redistributive agenda on the table an agenda to take on the billionaire class with more than rhetoric and use the money for a green new deal such a plan could not create a tidal wave of well paying unionised jobs bring badly needed resources and opportunities to communities of colour and insist that polluters should pay for workers to be retrained and fully included in this future it could not fashion policies that fight institutionalised racism economic inequality and climate change at the same time it could not take on bad trade deals and police violence and honour indigenous people as the original protectors of the land water and air people have a right to be angry and a powerful intersectional left agenda can direct that anger where it belongs while fighting for holistic solutions that will bring a frayed society together such a coalition is possible in canada we have begun to cobble it together under the banner of a peoples agenda called the leap manifesto endorsed by more than 220 organisations from greenpeace canada to black lives matter toronto and some of our largest trade unions bernie sanders amazing campaign went a long way towards building this sort of coalition and demonstrated that the appetite for democratic socialism is out there but early on there was a failure in the campaign to connect with older black and latino voters who are the demographic most abused by our current economic model that failure prevented the campaign from reaching its full potential those mistakes can be corrected and a bold transformative coalition is there to be built on that is the task ahead the democratic party needs to be either decisively wrested from pro corporate neoliberals or it needs to be abandoned from elizabeth warren to nina turner to the occupy alumni who took the bernie campaign supernova there is a stronger field of coalition inspiring progressive leaders out there than at any point in my lifetime we are leaderful as many in the movement for black lives say so lets get out of shock as fast as we can and build the kind of radical movement that has a genuine answer to the hate and fear represented by the trumps of this world lets set aside whatever is keeping us apart and start right now naomi klein is the author of this changes everything capitalism versus the climate she tweets @naomiaklein.,FAKE

opened fire early sunday morning in a packed orlando nightclub killing 50 people and wounding at least 53 more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern us history isis claimed responsibility for the attack sunday afternoon via its amaq news agency reuters reported amaq said an islamic state fighter carried out the assault it was not clear however if the shooting was actually directed by the terror group or only inspired by it the attack in orlando at pulse which bills itself as the hottest gay bar in the city and was packed with more than 300 people for latin night was reported minutes after 2 am sunday it ended hours later when police stormed the building and killed the shooter dozens of partygoers remained hostage in the club for several hours after the initial shooting prompting swat teams to rush inside shortly after 6 am local time orlando police tweeted that the gunman had been killed authorities said there was not believed to be any further threat to the area we know enough to say this was an act of terror and an act of hate president obama said in a speech from the white house on sunday cautioning that it was still early in the investigation house intelligence committee ranking member rep adam schiff said in a statement that the timing and location of the attack and information coming from local authorities indicated an isis inspired act of terrorism the fact that this shooting took place during ramadan and that isis leadership in raqqa has been urging attacks during this time that the target was an lgbt night club during pride and if accurate that according to local law enforcement the shooter declared his allegiance to isis indicates an isis inspired act of terrorism schiff said whether this attack was also isis directed remains to be determined i m confident that we will know much more in the coming hours and days the gunman omar mir seddique mateen was heard shouting allah akbar while engaging officers law enforcement sources told fox news mateen also called 911 during the shooting to pledge allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi fox news reported mateen was interviewed three times by fbi agents twice in 2013 once in 2014 as part of two separate investigations fbi assistant special agent in charge ron hopper said however both inquiries proved inconclusive and the cases were closed mateen was not under surveillance or the subject of an active investigation at the time of the shooting hopper said the 2013 investigation was related to comments mateen allegedly made to a co worker alleging possible terror ties fbi agents were unable to verify the substance of his comments hopper said mateen was also interviewed in 2014 due to his ties to an american man who later drove an explosive laden truck into a restaurant in syria for an al qaeda affiliate mateen and the suicide bomber monar abu salha attended the same mosque however the fbi determined their contact was minimal chairman of the house homeland security committee mike mccaul told fox news mateen was a us citizen rep alan grayson said during a sunday morning news conference though that was not true of other family members of his mateen 29 lived in fort pierce fla he was born in new york to parents of afghan origin and was a muslim fox news confirmed mateen was married in 2009 to a woman who was born in uzbekistan according to the couples marriage license but the two divorced in 2011 he was not a stable person the ex wife who spoke on condition of anonymity told the washington post he beat me he would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn t finished or something like that a mortgage form from 2013 lists noor salman as his wife and mateen also had a 3 year old son mateen appears to have had no criminal record a licensed security officer mateen also had a statewide firearms license he purchased two guns a handgun and a long gun legally during the week before the shooting an atf official said the fbi was scouring mateens cellphone and electronic devices on sunday afternoon to identify any possible terrorist connections this includes searching for any traces of propaganda scrubbing of

called in six trauma surgeons including a pediatric surgeon dr michael cheatham said many of the wounded were critically ill due to their injuries cheatham said and the hospital was trying to reach

is an attack on all of us chief john mina of the orlando police department said officers were initially engaged in a gun battle outside the club before the suspect armed with a handgun and assault type rifle went back into the building where more shots were fired he said the gunman then took several hostages it appears he was organized and well prepared mina said officials said mateen had some communication with police during this standoff though they did not reveal what was said eleven officers were involved in raiding the nightclub and one officer was injured according to banks the

85,as the constitutional convention of 1787 ended ben franklin walked out of philadelphias independence hall to find an anxious crowd according to a diary entry recorded by james mchenry a signatory to the constitution a woman from philadelphia was the first to speak to franklin well doctor she asked “what have we got a republic or a monarchy? a republic franklin famously replied “if you can keep it perhaps we cannot this reads like hyperbole but is it? consider for a moment the knifes edge on which the republic rests the election is 24 hours away as i write this donald trump is 18 points behind hillary clinton in the realclearpolitics polling average and here is what we know of donald trump he is a man who routinely praises dictators of vladimir putin trump said hes running his country and at least hes a leader unlike what we have in this country of kim jong un trump said you ve got to give him credit he goes in he takes over and hes the boss it is incredible of saddam hussein trump said he killed terrorists he did that so good they didn t read them the rights it is not just that trump admires authoritarians; it is that the thing he admires about them is their authoritarianism their ability to dispense with niceties like a free press due process and political opposition trump has promised in public and repeatedly to bring this hammer to american governance he stood in a nationally televised debate and vowed to jail his opponent if elected he has proposed strengthening libel laws to make it easier to cow the press and antitrust laws to punish jeff bezos and amazon for the washington posts coverage of his candidacy in a recent speech at gettysburg meant to preview his first 100 days in office trump said he would sue all of the women who accused him of sexual assault during rallies trump has exhorted his followers to assault protestors and has promised to pay their legal fees if their thuggery leads to arrest he has warned that the only way he could not lose the election would be if it is rigged and has suggested he may refuse to concede and all this ignores his more basic flaws he is cruel lazy and reckless he knows nothing of policy and has not bothered to find anything out he is easily baited reliant on sycophants and prone to conspiracy theories he is a bigot who slimed an american born judge for his mexican heritage and a misogynist who boasted that his celebrity gave him license to commit sexual assault he has cast doubt on americas commitment to the nato alliance and offhandedly encouraged saudi arabia and japan to build nuclear weapons his business is rife with conflicts of interest and his campaign has been amateurish and poorly managed here is the compliment i can pay donald trump and i pay it with real gratitude he never hid who he was perhaps he lacked the self control or the self awareness whatever the reason he never obscured his authoritarian tendencies his will to power his sexism his greed his dishonesty his racism his thirst for vengeance and he is still only 18 points behind it is likely though not certain that hillary clinton will win on tuesday but even if she does here is what must be said of american politics in 2016 we came within inches of electing donald j trump president of the united states of america we did this even knowing exactly what he stood for exactly what he had threatened to do exactly what kind of man he was a narrow trump loss is another way of saying a near trump win a 3 point victory for clinton implies that if trump were merely a bit more self disciplined if he had not bragged about sexual assault while wearing a microphone if his opponents pneumonia had lingered a bit longer america would be ruled by a cruel narcissist with authoritarian ambitions it will mean that if unemployment were a few percentage points higher if the man who murdered two police officers last week had been brown rather than white if trumps odd bedfellows alliance of russian hackers and angry fbi agents had been a bit more effective trump would have won perhaps on tuesday we will dodge the bullet but we will still need to understand how we came to be standing in front of a gun there is a comforting and popular explanation for trumps rise he is the product of an extraordinary period of economic pain demographic anxiety and elite backlash this argument holds that the condition of the country or at least the condition of trumps supporters is catastrophic and trumps rise is a response to the suffering this is reassuring; it makes trump into a kind of political natural disaster a hurricane that relied on a rare alignment of winds and rains and warmth a combination that occurs once in lifetime and can be forgotten once it is been survived but there is nothing in polls of national attitudes or indicators of economic health that reveals this moment as uniquely fertile for the rise of a strongman in 1992 when pat buchanan ran for president on a trump like platform unemployment was higher consumer confidence was lower and americans reported themselves more dissatisfied with the state of the country but buchanan lost handily and as we have learned more about trumps supporters and have come to understand more about the year in which he rose these explanations have grown more and more strained the belief that trump is a predictable reaction to acute economic duress crumbled before the finding that his primary voters had a median household income of 72000 dollars well above both the national average and that of clinton supporters the idea that trumpism arose as a response to a stalled economy collapsed as america experienced its longest sustained run of private sector job growth and the highest single year jump in median incomes in modern history the idea that trump was a reaction to failed trade deals and heavy competition from immigrants slammed into data showing support for him showed no relationship to lost manufacturing jobs and was strongest in areas without immigrant labor the idea that trump is a reaction to historic disgust with american elites is at war with president barack obamas approval ratings which have risen above 50 percent and now match ronald reagans at this point in his presidency the reality is that the patterns of trumpism the trends of the us economy and the polls measuring the american mood have stubbornly refused to fit the comforting theory that this is an extraordinary candidacy that could not only emerge in an extraordinary moment indeed if this were a period as thick with economic pain and anti establishment sentiment as the pundits pretend trumps victory would likely be assured once you appreciate that fact the lesson of trumpism becomes much scarier we are more vulnerable than we thought to reactionary strongmen it can happen here to americans of another era particularly the founding era it would seem bizarre that we are reaching so far and straining so hard to explain the popular appeal of a charismatic demagogue as former bush speechwriter michael gerson wrote the american political system is structured the way it is in part due to the founders fear of demagogues it is a reason why the american presidency is so weak why the executive is checked by other branches why the senates members were originally selected by state legislators it is a credit to the long success of our political institutions that we think dangerous men can only win elections in far off lands and so it is the weakening of those institutions that demands our attention now donald trumps nearness to the presidency rests on two separate accomplishments or if you prefer two separate institutional failures that are often conflated the first is his victory in the republican partys presidential primaries the second is his consolidation of elite republicans and of the republican leaning electorate trump won the republican party primaries with 138 million votes the distance between those 138 million voters and the more than 60 million votes he is expected to receive tomorrow is vast and was far from assured in 1972 for instance george mcgovern won the democratic primary even though much of the democratic party viewed him with suspicion and even fear major democratic interest groups like the afl cio refused to endorse him in the general election and top democrats including former governors of florida texas and virginia organized “democrats for nixon mcgovern went on to lose with less than 40 percent of the vote a dismal showing driven by democrats who abandoned a nominee they considered unacceptable a similar path was possible for trump elites within the republican party viewed him with horror his primary opponents spoke of him in apocalyptic terms ted cruz called trump a pathological liar utterly amoral and a narcissist at a level i don t think this countrys ever seen rick perry said trumps candidacy was a cancer on conservatism and it must be clearly diagnosed excised and discarded rand paul said trump is a delusional narcissist and an orange faced windbag a speck of dirt is way more qualified to be president marco rubio called him “dangerous and warned that we should not hand the nuclear codes of the united states to an erratic individual and then every single one of those republicans endorsed trump ted cruz told americans to vote for the pathological liar rick perry urged people to elect the cancer on conservatism rand paul backed the delusional narcissist marco rubio campaigned to hand the nuclear codes of the united states to an erratic individual the list goes on paul ryan the republican speaker of the house of representatives has endorsed trump as has mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader and reince priebus the head of the republican national committee mike pence the governor of indiana commiserated with dan senor a former bush appointee over the fact that trump was “unacceptable and then became his vice president with this kind of elite consolidation it is little wonder that trump has managed to consolidate republican leaning voters behind him the final nbc/wsj poll of the election found that 82 percent of likely republican voters were supporting trump precisely matching the 82 percent of likely democratic voters supporting clinton trump did not get mcgoverned there are two analyses that must be made of this the first is moral there are many republicans who honestly believe trump will make a good or at least adequate president; their endorsement of his candidacy is perfectly honorable even if i think it wrongheaded but many of the republicans mentioned here believe trump is a threat to world peace and to fundamental norms values and institutions of american democracy; their endorsements of his candidacy will stain the rest of their careers and if he is elected and if the worst comes to pass they will be remembered by history for their abandonment of country the second analysis that must be made is structural and believe it or not thats where things get scary political scientist julia azari has written the single most important sentence for understanding both trumps rise and this dangerous era in american politics “the defining characteristic of our moment is that parties are weak while partisanship is strong here is the problem in short parties and particularly the republican party can no longer control whom they nominate but once they nominate someone once they nominate anyone that person is guaranteed the support of both the partys elites and its voters unlike in mcgoverns day when ticket splitting was common any candidate able to win his partys presidential primaries can now count on his partys support and so has a damn good chance of winning the presidency political parties and political party primaries were traditionally bulwarks against demagogues rising in american politics they were controlled by gatekeepers who acted as checks against charismatic demagogues donald trump would never have made it through the convention horse trading that used to drive nominations; he would never have survived a process that required support from party officials but in recent decades we have slowly destroyed the ability of party officials to drive party primaries whats more we have come to see party officials exercising influence as fundamentally illegitimate “political scientists think of parties as the fundamental building blocks of democracy and people think of them as the impediment to democracy says hans noel a political scientist at georgetown university “in other systems you wouldn t even have primaries the whole thing would happen at a party convention but here when the dnc makes choices that influence the outcome of a primary that looks undemocratic the results have been stark the reigning political science theory of primaries going into this election was known as “the party decides and it stated basically that party elites controlled primary outcomes by driving money media attention and endorsements no single idea has been as decisively wrecked by 2016 as that one and when you examine the reasons for its failure you see they are unlikely to end with trump money turned out to be much less important to winning primaries than anyone thought just ask jeb bush who spent 130 dollars million only to be humiliated even as trump spent almost nothing to win moreover the internet keeps making it easier to fundraise off an energized base a dynamic that is empowering high enthusiasm outsider candidates like bernie sanders and ted cruz and weakening party establishments and the big dollar donors they control similarly parties used to drive media attention by signaling to reporters which candidates to take seriously but that process too has been democratized social media makes it easy to communicate with supporters directly and made it more valuable for audience hungry media outlets to cover the candidates with intense fan bases that senator stories viral across facebook or reddit that again favors exciting outsiders with enthusiastic supporters over vetted establishment grinds but the primary resource party officials have when influencing primary elections is the trust of voters thats why endorsements are important and have traditionally been predictive of the eventual winner they represent party officials using the credibility they have built with their voters to persuade them of whom to vote for trump didn t have any republican endorsements to speak of until he had already won a slew of primaries but the void of official support arguably helping him it was proof that he really was untouched and untainted by the unpopular republican party establishment this represented the republican party failing at the most basic job of a political party helping its voters make good decisions the gops elites have so totally lost the faith of their base that their efforts to persuade republican voters were ignored at best and counterproductive at worst but this also presents a puzzle if partisans have lost so much faith in their party establishments then why are they so much likelier to back whomever their party nominates? the answer in short is fear and loathing of the other party since 1964 the american national election studies have been asking republicans and democrats to describe their feelings toward the other party on a scale that runs from cold and negative to warm and positive in 1964 31 percent of republicans had cold negative feelings toward the democratic party and 32 percent of democrats had cold negative feelings toward the republican party by 2012 that had risen to 77 percent of republicans and 78 percent of democrats today fully 45 percent of republicans and 41 percent of democrats believe the other partys policies “threaten the nations well being this fear is strongest among the most politically involved which makes sense you re more likely to take an active interest in american politics if you think the stakes are high but that means the people driving american politics and particularly the people driving low turnout party primaries have the most apocalyptic view of the other side this is driven by the reality that the two parties have grown more ideologically distant from each other and so the stakes of elections really have grown larger in 1994 34 percent of republicans were more liberal than the median democrat and 30 percent of democrats were more conservative than the median republican today only 8 percent of republicans are more liberal than the median democrat and only 6 percent of democrats are more conservative than the median republican and polarization begets polarization the angrier and more fearful partisans are the more of a market there is for media that makes them yet angrier and yet more fearful it is no accident that the ceo of breitbart news a hyper ideological conservative media outlet that specializes in scaring the hell out of its audience is leading trumps campaign one reason trump has been able to consolidate republican support is that republican leaning media has convinced itself and its base that the alternative to trump is a criminal who belongs in jail this offers a rationale for voting republican even if you don t particularly like your candidate a majority of trump voters say they are voting against clinton rather than for trump this raises the possibility that trumps support from republicans is merely an artifact of clintons unpopularity i m skeptical before they had convinced themselves clinton is a criminal many republicans led by trump convinced themselves obama was born in kenya and constitutionally ineligible to serve as president and while those attacks were driving obamas popularity down clintons numbers were so high that it became fashionable to speculate over whether obama needed to replace joe biden with clinton to win reelection clintons weaknesses are real but her unpopularity among republicans is structural her four percent approval rating among republicans isn t so far off from the six percent obama registered at the end of the 2012 election “we ve got this online media where the profits are driven by controversy and clicks sarah rumpf a former breitbart writer told vox “it is just an activism problem in general where it is easier to fundraise and easier to get members when you can declare an emergency when you can declare a crisis when you can identify an enemy this helps explain the unified party support for donald trump republican officeholders are terrified that if they don t support him or are seen as in any way contributing to clintons election they ll face the wrath of their conservative base and be defeated in the primary challenges that the tea party used to such devastating effect in 2010 and 2012 paul ryan got a taste of this after distancing himself from trump after the release of the access hollywood tape his popularity plummeted and a majority of republicans said they preferred to see trump representing the party than ryan so here then is the key failure point in modern american politics and observing it in action requires looking no further than the republican party voters dislike of their own party has broken the primary process but fear of the opposition has guaranteed unified party support to the nominee that means whoever manages to win a flawed competition dominated by the angriest most terrified partisans ends within spitting distance of the presidency party primaries were traditionally bulwarks against demagogues rising in american politics now they are the method by which they will rise “the thing i keep coming back to is the muslim ban says msnbcs chris hayes “that was an actual policy he called for while running for president and if you switched in jews for muslims it was immediately clear what it was and it wasn t disqualifying to me that was so so upsetting hayes is the author of the book twilight of the elites and he has spent a lot of time thinking about elite failures and there were elite failures that led to trump the anger left over from the iraq war and from the financial crisis is certainly part of his rise but the other problem with elites this year is harder to talk about they were underpowered “the gatekeepers have been extraordinarily diminished hayes says “the best example of this to me is the newspaper editorial page it is the ultimate old school gatekeeper i find it so remarkable that the columbus dispatch usa today all these gatekeepers have come to the proper correct conclusion on trump and said no fucking way! but no one cares they don t control the gate they can lock the gate and someone can walk around it three feet down the fence elites are often blamed for trumps rise he is said to be the backlash to their failures their corruption their obliviousness their self dealing their cosmopolitanism their condescension all that may be true but past moments in american politics have also featured angry voters out of touch elites and social problems those moments however featured political and media gatekeepers with more power and so trump like candidates were destroyed in primaries or at conventions or by a press that paid them little mind now however traditional gatekeepers have neither the power nor the cultural capital to stop trump like candidates and in the republican party where the collapse of institutional authority is most severe and most dangerous the aftermath of a trump loss will further weaken the partys center as trumps supporters turn on the elites whose tepid backing they will argue doomed their candidate sean hannity for instance has already called paul ryan a “saboteur and breitbart published an article headlined “hes with her inside paul ryans months long campaign to elect hillary clinton president it is hard to see how the republican partys core institutions or top officials emerge strengthened if trump loses narrowly and it is likely that they will be effectively replaced co opted or hollowed out if he wins meanwhile the social conditions that led to trump the rapid browning of america foremost among them will persist and even accelerate already nonwhites make up a majority of children under 3 years old the country is on a fast path to becoming majority minority and many white male voters will continue to perceive this change as a loss in both status and political power which in some ways it is eventually these conditions will run into a recession that brings with it much sharper economic pain this is not to say republicans will always or even routinely nominate candidates as dangerous as trump much had to go wrong for him to be nominated but having been nominated much will have to go right for the country not to elect him and more will have to go right for it to not elect someone like him in the future the lesson of this unnerving year is that less can be taken for granted than we thought the american people are not immune to demagogues and the american political system is too weakened to reliably stop them america like all the worlds other countries is vulnerable to catastrophic political failure it can happen here trump will likely lose on tuesday but if he loses it will be because he is a crude undisciplined demagogue the world also produces clever disciplined demagogues and they are the ones who truly threaten republics.,REAL

1512,(cnn) in any normal presidential election it would be hard to overshadow news that the fbi interviewed one of the candidates for three and a half hours about potential criminal behavior but in 2016 donald trump seems to be able to seize any news cycle intentionally or otherwise his saturday tweet of a graphic that included hillary clintons face a six pointed star a pile of cash and the words most corrupt candidate ever drew immediate backlash for evoking anti semitic imagery the image was posted 10 days earlier to an anti semitic white supremacist message board the graphic @realdonaldtrump tweeted yesterday was first posted on an anti semitic forum pictwittercom/rfeb7bkgfm trump on monday morning initially addressed the controversy again on twitter by blaming the dishonest media for trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriffs star or plain star! dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriffs star or plain star! on monday afternoon the trump campaign finally issued a statement on the matter one that amounted more to a response to the clinton campaign statement than an explanation of his tweet trump rejected the clinton campaigns accusations that his tweet was anti semitic by slamming false attacks and insisting the star represented a sheriffs badge these false attacks by hillary clinton trying to link the star of david with a basic star often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior showing an inscription that says crooked hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever with anti semitism is ridiculous trump said in a statement trumps statement did not address the fact that the campaign tweeted an image that had previously been posted on an anti semitic white supremacist message board his statement also didn t explain where the campaign obtained the image on monday night the trump campaigns social media director daniel scavino filled in some details on what he said were the images origins the social media graphic used this weekend was not created by the campaign nor was it sourced from an anti semitic site scavino said in a statement separate from trumps it was lifted from an anti hillary twitter user where countless images appear the sheriffs badge which is available under microsofts shapes fit with the theme of corrupt hillary and that is why i selected it scavino added scavino also said that as the campaigns social media director i would never offend anyone and therefore chose to remove the image trumps stumbles were suddenly back in the spotlight on a weekend that would have otherwise focused on clintons vulnerabilities trumps prolific twitter habit is once again forcing republicans to confront questions about the temperament of the man they will soon formally nominate as their presidential candidate and his apparent unwillingness to forcefully reject the support of those with racist or anti semitic views it also comes as trump tries to manage a more disciplined campaign underscoring fears among some in the republican party that the businessman is unable to avoid self inflicted wounds adding to the fire is the trump campaigns refusal to answer questions about the tweet its origin or whether anyone would be held accountable it simply deleted the tweet and replaced the six pointed star with a circle the clinton campaign blasted trumps tweet monday as part of a broader pattern donald trumps use of a blatantly anti semitic image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough but the fact that it is part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern sarah bard hillary for americas director of jewish outreach said in a statement now not only won t he apologize for it hes peddling lies and blaming others trump should be condemning hate not offering more campaign behavior and rhetoric that engages extremists it is not the first time trumps own controversies have overshadowed clintons as a result of the presumptive republican nominees unforced errors two days before trump created a weeks long news cycle by accusing a judge of being biased because of his mexican heritage clinton faced one of the most damaging news items of her candidacy when the state departments inspector general released a scathing assessment of clintons private email use but trumps tirade on the judge his doubling down on those race based accusations and the ensuing rift it provoked between trump and newly supportive republican leaders eclipsed clintons email woes shielded by the holiday weekend top republicans in the house and senate were quiet on trumps latest controversy but the campaigns refusal to show any sense of accountability when it comes to the tweet may only add to the storm the first prominent trump surrogate to address the controversy was not a campaign spokesperson or trump himself but was instead trumps recently ousted campaign manager corey lewandowski who blamed political correctness run amok for the outcry during a sunday interview on cnns state of the union there is no anti semitism in mr trumps body not one ounce not one cell he told cnns alisyn camerota adding later not every six sided star is a star of david trump on sunday meanwhile refused to address the controversy over his tweet and sought to refocus scrutiny onto clinton he slammed a totally rigged system that likely will not bring criminal charges against clinton and criticized former president bill clintons private meeting with the us attorney general loretta lynch just days earlier he then tweeted condolences on the passing of holocaust survivor and nobel peace prize laureate elie wiesel but still no word about his use of an image circulating in anti semitic circles trumps tweet monday addressing the graphic may only serve to further extend the controversy drawing attention away from both clintons email scandal and a news cycle this week that was expected to focus on trumps imminent decision to pick a running mate before the republican party convention trumps latest trouble is especially loaded because it is not the first instance of him tweeting or retweeting something linked to white supremacists trump has previously retweeted neo nazi accounts including one named @whitegenocidetm in november he retweeted a graphic of false and racist crime statistics overstating the numbers of blacks killed by other blacks and amid a groundswell of support from white supremacists trump and his campaign have been slow and even loathe to reject the support of those individuals when pressed by cnns jake tapper earlier this year on the support of former ku klux klan leader david duke who continues to peddle in anti semitic conspiracy theories trump initially said falsely he did not know of duke and would not disavow his support he would later do so and blame a faulty earpiece and when he was later confronted by cnns wolf blitzer about anti semitic death threats some of his supporters were directing at a jewish reporter who wrote a profile about trumps wife the presumptive republican nominee refused to condemn those actions i don t have a message to the fans trump said when pressed on the anti semitic death threats in an interview with blitzer in may a woman wrote an article thats inaccurate now questions continue to swirl around how his campaign obtained and decided to tweet a graphic that had circulated on a message board filled with anti semitic conspiracy theories and neo nazi message boards and whether he will repudiate the support of individuals who prescribe to that ideology.,REAL

186,email just days before the presidential election numerous pundits and politicos are weighing in on who the next occupant of the oval office might appoint to the supreme court should current justices retire during the next presidential term while party affiliation has not shown itself to be a reliable guide to the ideological fidelity of a judge once hes secured a seat on the high courts bench there are some clues as to what hillary clinton might look to accomplish with her appointments should she be sworn in next january first given her constant claim that she will make sure to ensure the safety of american children by the enactment of common sense gun restrictions it is more likely than not that a president hillary clinton would seek to seat a pro confiscation jurist on the supreme court although in 2008 the supreme court ruled in favor of protecting individual gun rights from government abridgment the decision is dc v heller was 5 4 and even a slight shift toward curtailing the exercise of the rights protected by the second amendment could not seriously threaten the liberty of americans in fact there is no doubt how hillary clinton will handle the second amendment and how judges she nominates will look at the issue leaked audio from a new york fundraiser makes clintons gun control agenda crystal clear she wants to reinstate her husbands disarmament design “i was proud when my husband took [the national rifle association] on and we were able to ban assault weapons but he had to put a sunset on it 10 years later of course [president george w] bush wouldn t agree to reinstate [the ban] said clinton in other words she wouldn t hesitate to reinstate it if given the chance we ve got to go after this and here again the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment and i am going to make that case every chance i get the democratic nominee promised during the third presidential debate clinton spoke of the heller decision saying she disagreed with the way the court applied the second amendment in that case and that she would work to get that decision overturned there is another recent supreme court ruling has in her sights the citizens united case (citizens united v federal election commission ) in 2009 the supreme court came to a narrow decision in this case too ruling 5 4 that expenditures by for profit corporations labor unions and other associations cannot be restricted by government hillary clinton considers this holding too to be up for overruling should she move in to the white house in 2017 at another debate clinton said the citizens united case undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system in other words clinton doesn t want any organization being able to influence us political policy unless they make a substantial donation to the clinton foundation first finally there is little chance of roe v wade being overturned by a clinton appointed supreme court and in fact the legal prohibition on late term abortion is likely to be removed during a hillary clinton presidential administration the holding in the case of gonzalez v carhart (2007) that retained the restriction on late term abortions will be in the crosshairs during a clinton presidency as mister clinton has made it clear that she wants an exception carved out of the ruling in the case of a threat to the health of the mother in its opinion the court declared that uncertainty [in the medical community] over whether the barred procedure is ever necessary to preserve a womans health thus it did not qualify for protection under the roe v wade decision this won t do in the world clinton and her cronies inhabit a world where unborn babies are masses of cells and killing babies is a form of birth control during the last presidential debate hillary clinton declared “i do not think that the united states government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions so you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account these decisions are likely only a few of the cases that would come under renewed scrutiny should hillary clinton become president while we may not know which decisions clinton would target we do know a bit about the philosophy she would employ in the selecting of supreme court nominees during debate clinton explained how the constitution would figure into the process she would use to identify potential high court justices when asked about who she would nominate clinton explained you know i think when we talk about the supreme court it really raises the central issue in this election namely what kind of country are we going to be? what kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? what kind of rights will americans have? and i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system so along with gun control free speech and abortion clinton would try to appoint justices that would carry her water and uphold the rights of the radical homosexual lobby among others it isn t surprising that in her answer to the question certain supreme court decisions and how as president she would try to influence them hillary clinton never mentioned the constitution none of the foregoing analysis of hillary clintons judicial assault on the fundamental liberties it was written to protect would matter should americans appreciate the correct constitutionally established relationship among the three branches of the federal government and the absolute sovereignty of the people take a lesson from thomas jefferson who explained the proper procedure in a letter to abigail adams you seem to think it devolved on the judges to decide on the validity of the sedition law but nothing in the constitution has given them a right to decide for the executive more than to the executive to decide for them jefferson then told mister adams that each branch of the general government is “independent in the sphere of action assigned to them to allow the nine black robed justices to be the ultimate and unchallengeable arbiter of what is and is not constitutional jefferson added “would make the judiciary a despotic branch restoring the supreme court back to its intended sphere of influence would take away from any future president the power to permanently and prejudicially undermine fundamental liberty please review our comment policy before posting a comment thank you for joining the discussion at the new american we value our readers and encourage their participation but in order to ensure a positive experience for our readership we have a few guidelines for commenting on articles if your post does not follow our policy it will be deleted no profanity racial slurs direct threats or threatening language no product advertisements please post comments in english please keep your comments on topic with the article if you wish to comment on another subject you may search for a relevant article and join or start a discussion there.,FAKE

338,(cnn) as the senates top democrat harry reid has loved nothing more than attacking the koch brothers and their influence over politics now democrats have to decide how to wage that battle without him heading into last years elections the nevada democrat delighted in repeatedly slamming charles and david koch using the senate floor to call them un american and accuse them of trying to buy america as he flaunted the mega donors ties to the republican party but many of the candidates backed by the kochs won in 2014 democrats lost control of the senate and reid will retire at the end of next year setbacks aside reid insists he has no regrets about his strategy and doesn t plan to back down during his remaining time on capitol hill in a brief interview recently he told cnn he will go after the kochs as much as i can before retiring but once hes gone will a new democratic ringleader take over reids mission of casting the kochs as modern political villains? sen chuck schumer in line to take reids job in 2017 declined to comment when asked about the koch brothers senate minority whip district of columbia durbin said his party shouldn t ever back away from scrutinizing the kochs but pressed on whether he has any interest in assuming reids role of chief antagonist the senator from illinois chuckled it isn t as though harry hands the baton off to anyone hillary clinton the presumed democratic presidential front runner has yet to mention the kochs publicly since launching her second white house bid she has however indicated plans to help raise money for a pro clinton super pac that democrats hope could not rival the kochs fundraising prowess meanwhile the kochs are doubling down the billionaire industrialists seem more eager than ever to flex their muscles in 2016 an election cycle that is certain to cement their status as two of the most powerful republican donors in an era of virtually unlimited outside political spending republicans have long declared the strategy of bashing the kochs a failure i ve heard democrats say it would have been worse without the koch strategy said tim phillips president of the koch brothers founded americans for prosperity whats worse than nine seats? it doesn t get much worse than that phillips says referring to the number of senate seats the republican party gained in 2014 koch industries spokesman ken spain said an anti koch campaign in 2016 will only be as successful as it was in the 2014 cycle if politicians or political organizations decide to double down on falsely attacking the reputations of koch industries its shareholders and 60 000 american employees it is likely to be as successful as it was in 2014 spain said in a statement to cnn but plenty of democrats including top strategists involved in the 2014 elections anti koch messaging insist that the kochs are not about to be let off the hook while most americans still don t even know who the koch brothers are some democrats argue that tying republicans to the media shy billionaires has helped identify the republican party as the party of wealthy people and special interests an image that has badly wounded candidates over time my view is not that democrats did too much of it but did too little democratic pollster geoff garin said rather than ending the koch attacks garin said that reids departure after 2016 would simply mean the message will be delivered by a chorus rather than a soloist but the 2014 cycle revealed just how difficult it is to convince voters that candidates are unfit for office simply because they ve benefited from donations from the kochs in west virginias 3rd congressional district democrats unleashed a torrent of ads slamming republican party candidate evan jenkins and the financial backing he received from the kochs democrats lost their battle there jenkins a former state senator defeated longtime rep north carolina rahall 55% to 45% andy sere a republican strategist who advised jenkins said the slew of anti koch ads in the district ultimately did little to paint jenkins in a negative light instead of using our guys record to prosecute a case against him they put all their eggs in a flimsy guilt by association attack that failed miserably even in this strongly populist district sere said there were some ads where they spent 26 seconds talking about the kochs and four seconds on jenkins which was fine by me democrats acknowledge that the koch strategy proved to be more potent in some races than others a major takeaway from 2014 was that attacks against the kochs resonate more deeply if they accuse the brothers and their business of directly hurting local constituents if you talk about the koch brothers as an amorphous dc big money and politics it is not a very effective message because people don t see how it affects them in their daily lives said eddie vale vice president of american bridge a democratic super pac but when you can connect it to peoples lives then it makes a lot more sense one model race democratic strategists point to is gary peters successful bid for the senate in michigan peters campaign and his supporters ran ads that not only criticized the kochs and their outsize spending in politics but also accused one of their companies of creating pollution in the state one democratic senatorial campaign committee ad slammed the kochs for hurting seniors and children with asthma it is obviously more effective when you have some sort of tangible issue or some sort of tangible action by the koch brothers that is inconsistent with their political agenda peters said if partisan strategists are torn on the effectiveness of the koch bashing tactic some political observers say the core strategy is worrisome the deeply personal and vitriolic statements and ads have set a dangerous precedent critics say by marking two private citizens as political targets even if they happen to be among the most wealthy and influential men in us politics i don t think it is really healthy for american politics to essentially have these proxy fights over these wealthy funders said bruce haynes of purple strategies a bipartisan consulting firm folks like the koch brothers have the money to defend themselves but if they didn t have the money to defend themselves and they re attacked by these large organizations like this it is a very chilling thought.,REAL

3265,pope francis has joined democrat legislators along with a handful of rinos and local mayors to work hand in hand with obama to push immigration from mexico and south america to the us every player in this scheme has their own agenda of course obama has only one desire and that is to fundamentally transform america democrat legislators are working to secure a dependent voting base the rinos (republicans in name only) are beholden to large corporations whose only goal is to secure cheap labor finally local mayors want the federal funding that comes with placement of each immigrant in their communities besides the obvious charitable aspect whats in it for pope francis? whats in it for the catholic church? many catholics (myself included) are wondering why we pass the collection basket more than once several times throughout the year to help subsidize churches schools and orphanages in mexico and south america if the ultimate goal is to bring them here? make no mistake pope francis is interjecting himself into the 2016 presidential election by walking with illegal aliens on the mexican side of the border who want to get into the usthis is a direct assault by the catholic church on donald trump and any other republicans (including the governor of texas) who say they want to close the us border with mexicoyesterday in ciudad juarez one of the most violent cities in the western hemisphere thanks to the drug cartels the pope walked up a ramp covered in flowers toward a cross erected in memory of migrants who have perished trying to reach the united states just a stones throw away according to reutersthe pope then blessed three more small crosses at which shoes of migrants who died were laid we cannot deny the humanitarian crisis pope francis intoned each step a journey laden with grave injustices the enslaved the imprisoned and extorted; so many of these brothers and sisters of ours are the consequence of trafficking in human beings injustice is radicalized in the young; they are cannon fodder persecuted and threatened when they try to flee the spiral of violence and the hell of drugs then there are the many women unjustly robbed of their lives he concluded let us together ask our god for the gift of conversion the gift of tears let us ask him to give us open hearts like the ninevites open to his call heard in the suffering faces of countless men and women no more death! no more exploitation! they are not refugees! people escaping poverty or crime are not legally refugees but the pope and the no borders left are purposefully confusing the terminology they want all migrants on the move to be called refugees who are then entitled to protection and welfare why stop at the mexican border? what about the iraqi christian population thats been almost completely wiped out? why is the pope standing on the mexican border demanding we open the flood gates in the name of charity while tens of thousands of christians are being slaughtered in the middle east?where is the outcry from the pope as the catholic charities/us conference of catholic bishops (cc/usccb) are being paid billions to bring mostly muslim immigrants who are being vetted by the corrupt un to the us from the middle east and strategically seeding them across the united states?

1658,humans are free as one of the very few independent voices willing to stand up against the scientific dogma of our modern medical regime i ve long felt a need to communicate the dangers of flu shots to the public so that people can have better information to prevent vaccine injuries and save lives this doesn t mean i m opposed to the theory of vaccination by the way in fact i m the author of a blueprint for safer vaccines an audio guide to saving lives and preventing vaccine injuries and deaths to my knowledge i m the only independent journalist in the world who is scientifically trained to run an atomic mass spectrometry laboratory which i ve been running for nearly a year now and testing the heavy metals content of organic superfoods like cacao common vaccines as well as the ability of water filers to remove toxic heavy metals i m the creator of the low heavy metals verified standard and i m the inventor of patent pending nutritional formulas for capturing heavy metals during digestion and binding with the radioactive isotopes of cesium (such as cesium 137) to eliminate them from the digestive tract both of these patents are on file with the us patent office awaiting a decision my independent atomic elemental analysis of flu vaccines published in the summer of 2014 proved that flu vaccines contain over 50 ppm mercury an extremely toxic heavy metal linked to kidney failure birth defects spontaneous abortions and neurological damage this finding has never been refuted by anyone in fact it was affirmed by vaccine proponents who insisted that it is perfectly safe to inject pregnant women young children and senior citizens with mercury even though the flu vaccine insert itself readily admits there is no scientific evidence whatsoever to support the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in such groups believe it or not there are still millions of people doctors pharmacists and even journalists who do not yet realize there is a very high concentration of mercury in influenza vaccines given to pregnant women children and senior citizens most people you see have been lied to by the media which has stated over and over again that mercury was removed from all vaccines thats simply not true it is still there and toxic mercury is present in influenza vaccines at a level thats literally 25 000 times higher than the epa limit of mercury in drinking water [7] it is 100 times higher than the highest level of mercury contamination i ve ever tested in ocean fish see the evidence for yourself to prove the presence of mercury in influenza vaccines i m going to show you four irrefutable pieces of evidence 1) photographs of a 2013 / 2014 influenza vaccine box admitting in very small print to the addition of mercury to the vaccine as a preservative 2) photographs of the influenza vaccine insert once again repeating the admission that the vaccine contains mercury 3) a screen shot from the centers for disease control website which admits that vaccines still contain the following ingredients aluminum antibiotics egg protein formaldehyde monosodium glutamate (msg) and thimerosal a mercury containing chemical compound 4) lab results from the natural news forensic food lab which confirmed almost precisely the same level of mercury claimed by the manufacturer (glaxosmithkline) before i show you the irrefutable evidence there is some good news in all this testing as part of this natural news investigation i tested several different vaccines including an hpv vaccine mercury levels were extremely low in these other vaccines only the flu shot contained extremely high mercury levels influenza vaccine box admits safety never established for pregnant women as you can see below the box for this flulaval influenza virus vaccine readily admits the use of thimerosal which contains mercury (of course you have to use a magnifying glass to see this) in microscopic text on the package insert it says straight out “register women who receive flulaval while pregnant in the pregnancy registry by calling 1 888 452 9622 yet at the same time the insert also admits that “safety and efficacy have not been established in pregnant women in other words this vaccine containing mercury is being promoted for use in pregnant women even when no safety in pregnant women has ever been established it is also important to note that when people are being given flu shots they are never handed the package or the insert so they have no opportunity to read any of this information unless they specifically ask for it it is not like a food item with a “nutrition facts label vaccines are sold in “stealth mode where patients have no idea whats in them and no opportunity to read possible warnings as further proof of this point consider the fact that this flu vaccine comes with only one insert yet it is a 10 dose vial intended to be injected into 10 different people clearly if there is only one insert but 10 people then 9 out of 10 people can t possibly be handed the insert unethical medicine administered without informed consent (a violation of medical ethics) in fact from a legal perspective vaccines are routinely injected into people without informed consent virtually no one administering vaccines ever explains the risks versus benefits of vaccines as is required under medical ethics and state medical law in nearly all cases patients are simply hoodwinked and told there are no risks at all the second piece of evidence to reveal here is the package insert for the influenza vaccine a document printed in microscopic text thats almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass of course the intention is that no one ever read this document because it contains shocking admissions of the total quackery and marketing deception behind flu shots as you can see from this snapshot the package insert readily admits that each vaccine dose “contains 50 mcg thimerosal (<25 mcg= mercury= p=><25 br= mcg= mercury=> in case you re wondering “mcg means micrograms a microgram is 1/1000th of a milligram mercury is toxic at any dose when injected into the body even in micrograms there is no such thing as a “safe form of mercury when injected in fact the ethyl form of mercury used in vaccines is many times more toxic than methyl form once it enters human cells click here for a fascinating interview with mercury toxicity expert dr chris shade who explains this extremely important concept the same paragraph shown above also admits the vaccine contains formaldehyde a potent neurotoxic chemical vaccine insert admits safety and effectiveness have never been established<25 br= mcg= mercury=> whats even more astonishing about this insert is that it openly admits the flu shot is a complete medical hoax backed by nothing but voodoo woo woo faith based dogma (and clever marketing) here are actual words from the insert (which is much more lengthy than the snapshot shown above) “there have been no controlled trials adequately demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with flulaval “safety and effectiveness of flulaval have not been established in pregnant women nursing mothers or children “safety and effectiveness of flulaval in pediatric patients have not been established “flulaval has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for impairment of fertility “do not administer flulaval to anyone… following previous administration of any influenza vaccine cdc admits use of mercury msg formaldehyde for those “mercury denialists who still can t believe flu shots given to pregnant women contain high concentrations of toxic mercury even the cdc reluctantly admits this fact on its own website heres a screen shot from the cdcs vaccine additives page which miraculously hasn t yet been removed from their site <25 br= mcg= mercury=> laboratory results from the natural news forensic food lab the final piece of irrefutable evidence on all this comes from my own scientific laboratory where i run icp ms instrumentation to test foods beverages dietary supplements and other items for heavy metals contamination i was the first food researcher to document high levels of tungsten in brown rice protein and i ve exposed alarming levels of lead in pet treats i ve also exposed high lead in ginkgo biloba herbal supplements imported from china when i finally got around to testing vaccines i was shocked to find over 51 000 ppb mercury in the influenza virus vaccine why was i shocked? because i don t recall ever seeing anything run through my icp ms instrument with that high a concentration of mercury the mercury in this flu vaccine was the highest concentration of mercury i ve ever seen in anything period! and this is a product thats injected directly into the bodies of pregnant women where mercury goes right into the developing fetus whats even more interesting is that this finding once again confirms the accuracy of my lab instrumentation because it is almost in perfect agreement with the level of mercury detailed on the vaccine package insert lets do the math * each dose of an influenza vaccine is 05 ml in volume * my lab found just over 50 ppm of mercury in the vaccine liquid * 50 ppm (concentration) x 05 ml (volume) equals 25 mcg of mercury guess what the package insert says? (up to) 25 mcg of mercury per dose near perfect agreement in other words my finding of 51 ppm rather than 50 ppm either means my own tests were off by about 2% (which is still considered very accurate for icp ms testing) or that gsk put 2% extra mercury into the vaccine and just so you know i actually did the tests heres what else we found with other analytes aluminum 04 ppm cadmium zero lead zero so i can confidently say that the flu vaccine won t poison you with lead cadmium or arsenic because it contains none of those things even the aluminum level is quite low and not a concern at this very low level the real problem is just the mercury at least as far as elements go why won t vaccine makers remove the mercury? good question everybody knows mercury is toxic to inject into the human body thats not debated except by irrational anti science denialists who refuse to acknowledge the table of elements you have to wonder why choose mercury as a preservative? and why do both the cdc and fda continue to look the other way as an entire branch of modern medicine poisons our women and children with a neurotoxic heavy metal? and if vaccine promoters propagandists and patent holders want the world to accept all their vaccines why don t they just remove the mercury and be done with it? if they take out all the toxic elements resistance to vaccines would all but evaporate why vaccines are the “anti science medical voodoo of the modern world ever wonder why they don t conduct legitimate clinical trials on flu vaccine efficacy? probably because they know the results would have to be faked to show any efficacy at all thats what merck did with its mumps vaccines according to two former virologists who worked there they spiked human blood samples with animal antibodies to fabricate positive results yep vaccines work so poorly that even the manufacturers have to fake their own results to show any efficacy vaccines are the one medicine where no scientific evidence of safety or efficacy is required by anyone not the fda not the cdc and not the media congress even passed a law protecting the vaccine industry with absolute legal immunity even when they manufacture and sell defective products that injure and kill people hows that for medicine we can all trust? think about it this is a product that contains multiple neurotoxins in very high concentrations; a product backed by no safety trials or efficacy data; a product linked to numerous serious adverse reactions; and yet a product that enjoys absolute legal immunity thanks to the us government if thats not outright medical quackery i don t know what is for the record i m not an opponent of all vaccines but i do believe as do a rapidly increasing number of other clear thinking people that medicine should not poison our women and children it is time for mercury to be removed from all vaccines once and for all anything less is medical negligence new video interview about flu shot failures ultimately we the people will be victorious in the removal of mercury from all vaccines an idea thats already well accepted across much of europe and when that day comes it will be yet another victory for the natural news fan base an amazing community of millions of remarkable people working together for the protection of our children our health and our world see my recent video interview with next news networks gary franchi on why flu shots are failures.,FAKE

4746,on top of all the problems this country faces under a donald trump administration anti vaxxers are hoping he will make widespread disease great againanti vaccination advocates literally believe that vaccines are harmful to children despite an avalanche of scientific research and the fact that we have nearly eradicated many viruses that used to kill thousands of people as proof to the contraryleading anti vaxxer andrew wakefield the moron who made parents panic by claiming to link vaccines to autism got to meet with trump to spew the same fraudulent claims that cost him his medical license for the first time in a long time i feel very positive about this because donald trump is not beholden to the pharmaceutical industry wakefield said he didn t rely upon [drug makers] to get him elected and hes a man who seems to speak his mind and act accordingly so we shall see now americans have to fear a world where anyone around them could not be carrying a disease that could not have been easily prevented by a harmless vaccine because trump is listening to a crackpotthus far the anti vaxxer movement has caused outbreaks of whooping cough rubella and measles just to name a few measles had been declared eradicated in 2000 but after many parents had a collective freak out they stopped vaccinating their damn kids and opened the door for measles and other diseases to return measles kicked that door down in 2015 when the disease struck many who were unvaccinated after a visitor from another country carried it and spread it to others at disneylandat the height of the outbreak fox medical expert dr march siegel blasted anti vaxxers and defended vaccines as necessary for the public health let me be clear on this i see no debate whatsoever siegel said period this is the greatest vaccine that has ever been created in the history of vaccines you know we stamped out measles in the united states in 2000 it was incredible because measles is the most contagious virus known to man if you had measles there would be a 90 percent chance that i would get it by sitting next to you if i weren t vaccinated it is so much more contagious than the flu we were talking about ebola this is a million times more contagious than ebola! your celebrities did not go to medical school! in california there is 13 000 parents that are taking a personal belief exemption allowing their kids to go to school without that second mmr vaccine you need one after you re 1 year old and then you need one again before you re 5 or 6 years old i think these parents are putting children at risk in schools i think schools should consider not allowing these kids in make them be homeschooled if they don t have this vaccine why should my child be a risk because your child isn t vaccinated? later that year the first american in over a decade died after contracting measlesand if donald trump aids anti vaxxers by changing federal policy he will become a direct threat to the public health as it becomes more likely that diseases once considered eradicated in this country thanks to vaccines return with a deadly vengeance all because we let a bunch of stupid people who reject science influence policyfeatured image mnn.,FAKE

the puukko was the smaller option used to skin fish or animals “although historical records vary the puukko dates back about 1000 years both men and women carried (and carry) puukkos although the sizes change depending on the person as the puukko handle is meant to fit the hand size of the user (from edc history pukko a simple knife with a rich history) the old design is getting some attention from modern knifemakers i recently reviewed the battle horse knives feather stick another knife with the puukko design and it worked out really well heres the hawks specs product details blade 3″ carbon steel handle 45″ stained curly birch full tang construction dangler style leather sheath total length 75″ grind convex is my all time go to favorite grind but scandi is a close second or third for a beginner it is the easiest to learn to sharpen on the bevel is sharpening guide all you do is lay it flat on a whetstone and hone away the scandi is also a great woodworking grind and a practical choice for someone looking for a bushcraft knife the hawk handle fits my large hands very well handle i have big hands size large gloves and many otherwise excellent knives don t work for me because the handle is too short i don t like two or three finger grips imo they don t give a secure grip for hard work and i m concerned they might twist in my hand the 45 incorporated handle fits my hand really really well it is made of dyed curly birch a common wood in russia and scandinavia with north carolina figure the wood makes a handle that doesn t transfer heat or cold this is a consideration for a knife that will be used in finlands frigid winter the diameter is large which gives me a good solid grip when wet or slimy from cleaning fish or bloody from butchering the handle seems to get “grippier a comfortable safe handle is a really important aspect of a user knife pretty doesn t cut it (pun intended) when there are lengthy cutting tasks to be done steel the high carbon steel holds a wicked edge i don t know exactly what it is but the hawks steel held up nicely to normal cutting and bushcraft tasks traditionally blade materials can vary from the three layer approach which combines strong and flexible steels to composite designs most are made with finnish steel ovako 100cr6 which is equivalent to us 52100 bearing steel according to nordic knife blog nordiska kniva r spine i would like the spine to be ground at a 90 degree angle like an ice skate so it could not be used for processing tinder or scraping a ferro rod it isn t but a few passes on a grinder could not fix that sheath the dangler style form fitted leather sheath holds the knife securely almost too securely it requires a slight twist to loosen the hawk it is a consideration the knife won t fall out but it is a two hand job to remove it this might be a deal breaker for some users i find this annoying but you can get used to the tight sheath full tang construction with a brass bolster i prefer a full tang on any rigid blade knife even though i ve never needed that extra strength in fact one of my favorite user knives the mora 840 companion has a plastic handle and a three quarter tang for the strongest knife available though get a full tang hand made in finland the hawk is a user knife able to handle a variety of tasks in actual use the hawk lives up to the user reputation of the puukko knives it went along on fremont districts webelos woods a boy scout outing recently it was used to whittle sticks and do the assorted tasks associated with camping on the way home on an isolated section of highway i saw a fast moving car hit a deer up ahead of me the front end of the vehicle was demolished and the hood popped the air bag deployed and the radiator was steaming after checking out the driver and passenger for injuries (they were shaken but fine) the driver and i followed the injured buck it had dragged itself across the road and was severely injured it was still alive with two broken legs probable internal injuries and it was in agonizing pain we called 911 rather than wait a possible half hour for the oregon state police to arrive we ended the deers suffering with the only tool available the kellam hawk the knife worked quickly and humanely for the sad but necessary task thats the march of a good knife it gets the job done do you need a hawk? everybody needs a good knife the hawk is based on a proven design with quality materials the hawk has proven to be a very useful tool and one that can be used in a variety of situations from slicing a bagel at work to hunting and fishing the knife retails for 7495 dollars and thats a steal for a handmade knife if you re looking for a good looking user that you can work hard and pass down to your grandchildren the hawk is a really good choice please click here to check out and subscribe to the survivalcommonsensecom youtube channel and here to subscribe to our weekly email update thanks!.,FAKE

3464,it has been well documented that donald trumps presidential campaign has been endorsed by multiple white supremacist groups one of the groups supporting trump is the american national super pac a branch of the organization the american freedom party is directing a new robocalling effort to try and connect their message with voters they called iowans before their caucus and they are now calling voters in new hampshirehere is the message people are hearing when they answer their phones we don t need muslims we need smart educated white people i am a farmer and white nationalist support donald trump here is a video that lets you hear the three different voices that have contributed to the message of those voices is that of jarod taylor tayler is well known white supremacist leader he is the editor of the white nationalist media outlet amren taylor has ties to various white supremacist organizations and has been very vocal in his support for trump during a segment on cnn taylor attempted to justify his views saying why would we want more muslims? muslims have been a terrible problem for europe and here they want to pray five times a day stop the assembly line they want foot baths before they go to prayer they want women only swimming pool hours and some of them want to kill us! why should anyone want more muslims? trump has denounced the endorsement by the group that being said it isn t surprising that hate groups have latched on to trumps campaign so far his campaign has been largely built by exploiting the anti brown hatred held by many conservativesthe trend has been that as more republican party candidates drop out of the race their followers flock to ted cruz and marco rubio so it seems like taylor and this group of racist friends may have backed the wrong horse to drive home their white advocacy agenda despite getting the media attention trumps stance on immigration is only nominally different that iowa republican party caucus winner ted cruz since the groups efforts appear to only be hurting trump lets hope the group decides to keep up their efforts backing whoever eventually gets the nomination in the general electionfeatured image from video screenshot via facebook.,FAKE

801,the band of black conservatives gathered at a washington hotel on a spring evening in 2013 with the future of their cause and the country on their minds joining them was ben carson the renowned neurosurgeon who d electrified republicans several weeks earlier with a sharp attack on president obamas policies at the national prayer breakfast now a half dozen of carsons admirers all prominent african american conservatives wanted him to go further over dinner in a palatial room at the willard intercontinental just two blocks from the white house they courted carson with views that had long set them apart from much of black america niger innis spokesman for the congress of racial equality said he thought obama would make it easier for a country to accept a black conservative as president antiabortion activist alveda king told carson that he “was a role model for my son not like obama whom she deemed so liberal that his inspirational pull went no further than his race and pizza magnate herman cain who d briefly been a republican presidential front runner in 2012 before being derailed by disputed sexual harassment allegations was eager to confront liberals in the next election cycle “kick their butts! he exhorted the group as they dined in the willards private holmes room it was cain who d invited carson to the gathering and the others suspected an unstated reason “it felt as if we were witnessing a passing of the torch innis says but only if carson was willing to trade his identity as a medical pioneer the first doctor in the world to separate twins conjoined at the back of the head for something far more polarizing a black republican party presidential candidate the decision to remake himself would be the culmination of a long political journey for carson but it also would reveal his sense of destiny and supreme self confidence he knew a run for the white house was likely to exact a steep price on his carefully cultivated public image his against the odds rise from poverty to accomplished pediatric neurosurgeon had made him an african american hero in speeches books and a movie about his life based on his autobiography “gifted hands he was inspirational aspirational and apolitical though he d always been conservative he publicly bragged about being a registered independent and he d already deflected another attempt to persuade him to step into the political arena after his prayer breakfast appearance the wall street journal published an editorial proclaiming “ben carson for president in response carson told reporters he did not wish to wade into the “cesspool of modern politics then he did it anyway he d flirted with running for office before about 11 years ago carson made an appointment with michael steele a black republican who was serving as lieutenant governor of maryland steele remembered the surprising discussion carson was thinking about entering into politics steele told him to be cautious “all the fancy résumés and wonderful things you ve done won t matter when someone wants to come after you steele said he told him “i ended that discussion and i remember it well by saying why would you want to sully such a wonderful reputation as a neurosurgeon with politics?   he then sought the counsel of donlin long who was the head of the neurosurgery department at johns hopkins according to long a group of republicans had approached carson about a run for the us senate long suggested a deeper question what do you want to do with your life? “there was no way he could not do both long explains “at his age at that point in his career he had to decide whether he was going to be a politician or a physician carson now 64 chose medicine the realm that had made him famous in 1987 after he d cut the brain blood vessel that connected conjoined infants patrick and benjamin binder a young carson stood in front of microphones and a gaggle of reporters at his first major news conference to describe the surgery the public fascination with the yale educated square jawed soft spoken black surgeon led to book deals biographical plays and public speeches in which he would promise young people that through faith in god and diligent study that they too could not lift themselves out of poverty [the story of the surgery that made ben carson famous] carson felt the message had a special resonance for african americans early in his medical career he grew tired of seeing “able bodied people who were not working he said in a december interview with the washington post they had grown dependent on welfare he concluded and he quietly found himself swayed by president ronald reagans argument that government had become the problem not the solution he didn t talk much then about his political evolution from a “flaming liberal to a staunch conservative he was still trying to reconcile his belief that republicans generally did not care about african americans and carson was quickly becoming a prominent figure in black america drawing the praise of liberal civil rights activists such as the rev jesse jackson and the rev al sharpton both said they reached out to carson but could not never get a read on him he was always courteous but always elusive “we just exchanged words of respect but it never really went beyond that jackson recalled in the spring of 1994 carson found himself in a room at the supreme court for a weekend of networking events with the horatio alger association an exclusive society of high fliers who started their lives in dire poverty attending was justice clarence thomas whose conservative ideals made him such a pariah among african americans that carson was somewhat skeptical of him in “supreme discomfort the divided soul of clarence thomas a biography written by two washington post reporters carson said he challenged thomas immediately when they met he asked why thomas was against busing when it was largely seen as a key instrument to help desegregate schools “he told me he didn t want these kids thinking they have to go somewhere else to be successful carson recalled in the book he concluded that thomass argument “made a lot of sense after his induction into the horatio alger society carson befriended other members such as terry giles a prominent white lawyer who grew up pumping water in the ozarks and bob brown an african american who had raised hogs in rural north carolina and became an adviser to president richard m nixon together they would laugh at each others “i was so poor jokes behind the humor was a subtle affirmation of the american dream and a reminder that the up from the bootstraps narrative was not exclusive to carson his friends at horatio alger shared similar traits they grew up poor many of them raised by a strong single parent or a grandparent who did not accept excuses they were service oriented and they usually voted republican “i came to realize that many of my political beliefs were based on nothing other than propaganda said carson who was a registered republican for a time before switching his party affiliation to independent in 2001 murray carson the eldest of his three children said his father would come home and devour programming on fox news particularly “the o reilly factor and “hannity and colmes “i don t know why people were so surprised he was so conservative or would run for office said murray carson a 32 year old web programmer “at our home he loved talking about this stuff as he neared retirement carson could not not stop talking about the state of the country in 2011 he co authored a book with his wife candy called “america the beautiful that detailed his increasing conservatism carson advocated tough punishments for terrorists proposed a flat tax expressed his admiration for the tea party and voiced disdain for political correctness he had grown frustrated at organizers who asked him not to utter the words “jesus christ during his speeches most of all he worried about the legacy of barack obama the president who had eclipsed him as an inspirational figure among african americans carson hated the explosion of the national debt and questioned whether those who supported obama saw anything beyond the fact that he was the first black president carson began to wonder whether his voice could not help to loosen the liberal grip on black americas politics he had spent decades building up a reservoir of goodwill he had given hundreds of college scholarships through the carson scholars fund and planted reading rooms in dozens of low income schools throughout the country “i always wanted to do what was needed to strengthen the country carson said “but i was preoccupied with medicine at the prayer breakfast in 2013 he took his outrage public criticizing obamas policies while standing at a lectern a few feet from the president carson talked about the country being in danger of falling like the roman empire from “moral decay and fiscal irresponsibility and he lambasted obamas signature health care overhaul as the presidents smile wilted into a grimace a viral video and a conservative folk hero were born armstrong williams the conservative commentator who serves as carsons business manager was thrilled “we are going to rachet it up he remembered thinking and they did the newer bolder carson was on television comparing homosexuality to bestiality causing such an uproar that he was forced to apologize then he called the presidents health care law “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery many who admired him were stunned “say it ain t so sharpton said were his first thoughts when he heard carsons slavery comparison “we ve had black republicans before so it is not that hes on the right that is particularly surprising sharpton said “it is that hes so far right that winter a conservative activist named mike murray knocked on the door of carsons new retirement home in florida carson answered the door in shorts and a t shirt he invited him to the living room and murray sat near candy carsons organ over three hours murray told carson he wanted him to be the face of an organization that would push for the repeal of obamacare “i m concerned about being too political murray remembers carson replying but murray was persuasive “people are hungry to hear from you he said “and you could not do this the right way together they ventured throughout the country urging legislators and voters to sign a petition everywhere they went murray recalled people told carson that he was the right one to deliver the hard truths about the state of the country carson basked in their admiration he said he began to believe that the country needed “someone who has been able to utilize the strength of lots of other people as well as their own intellect to solve problems that no one ever solved before maybe that would be a more useful skill set than time in washington dc “it has to be someone carson thought as he recalled it in an interview earlier last year then he chuckled “maybe it just happens to be me then came a sign from the divine according to murray the two men had agreed that carson would call the 100 000th person to sign the health care petition the woman did not want her full name made public murray said but he identified her in a mailer as a woman named emily from virginia when carson reached her murray said she told the neurosurgeon that her dying son was once one of carsons patients he helped to save him now she wanted him to run for president to save the country “i couldn t believe it murray said “everyone will think she was a plant in a february 2014 email to supporters carson wrote that he might have received “a wink from above that november carson grabbed a voter registration form in florida in the party field he checked “republican carson had written a whole book about making tough choices in “take the risk he laid out four key questions “whats the best thing that can happen if i do this? whats the worst thing that can happen if i do this? whats the best thing that can happen if i don t do it? whats the worst thing that can happen if i don t do it? now he asked himself those questions about a presidential campaign the best thing that would happen if he ran? “people would respond positively to my message he said “and we could not get back on the right track to restore the concept of fiscal responsibility the worst thing? “i would lose something that he hates to do “and you d get someone who had very bad ideas in there he said he considered the best case scenario if he didn t run the election of another candidate who would do a good job but that seemed far less likely than the worst case scenario another failed president before he made any decisions there was one person williams wanted carson to see in january 2015 williams drove him to the steps of the supreme court awaiting carson in his chambers was justice thomas “he warned me carson recalled “if you re black and conservative anything is fair game in terms of trying to destroy you giles echoed thomass warning during a visit to the carson home “everyone loves you giles said he told carson “if you run at least half the country is not going to like you anymore are you ready for it? the warnings would quickly prove true carson would be derided for suggesting that millions of armed jews would have survived the holocaust he d be laughed at for pronouncing the name of the militant group hamas as if it were a mediterranean chickpea dip some of the details in the carson autobiography about his temper would be questioned by reporters and disparaged by republican party rival donald trump as impossible to believe “crap and his campaign would first soar and then stumble with top advisers resigning in a new years eve campaign shake up but as giles and his wife sat with ben and candy carson on the porch of their florida home carson was resolute “i need to do what is best for my family and my country carson told giles “if somebody dislikes me for that thats okay with me “he seemed ready giles said “so i was in the doctor turned candidate had spoken the country needed a new direction and so did he.,REAL

389,the impassioned election year debate over president obamas immigration executive actions lands monday before a short handed supreme court where justices will consider a fundamental question how much power does the president truly have? the justices plan to hold 90 minutes of oral arguments dealing with obamas bid to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation a coalition of states calls it an executive power grab president obamas executive action is an affront to our system of republican self government said sen orrin hatch r utah who supports those states but the white house contends the presidents authority is clear and the policies humane and reasonable obama has promoted his program as a plan to prioritize deporting felons not families it is a case that will be closely watched in an election season where republican front runner donald trump has made immigration enforcement a centerpiece of his campaign the outcome also could not have considerable bearing on obamas legacy potentially determining whether his lame district of columbia bid to go around congress is upheld or ruled an overreach at issue monday is whether as many as 5 million illegal immigrants can be spared deportation including those who entered the us as children and the parents of citizens or legal residents the programs known as deferred action for parents of american citizens and permanent residents (dapa) and deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) effectively went around the republican led congress opponents including 26 states and republican party members of congress say the plan exceeds constitutional power a federal appeals court earlier had struck down dapa which has yet to go fully into effect the justice department then asked the high court for a final review in what could not be a key test of obamas executive powers his last year in office the decision to review the case was welcome on both sides of the aisle the constitution vests legislative authority in congress not the president said hatch urging the justices to rule against the administration but the white house voiced confidence the policies would be upheld like millions of families across this country immigrants who want to be held accountable to work on the books to pay taxes and to contribute to our society openly and honestly we are pleased that the supreme court has decided to review the immigration case spokeswoman brandi hoffine said the issue of illegal immigration has taken a center stage role in the republican primary battle as trump calls for a border wall between the us and mexico and candidates spar over who is toughest on the issue the immigrants who would benefit from the obama administrations plan are mainly parents of us citizens and lawful permanent residents solicitor general donald verrilli jr said in a court filing that allowing the past rulings to stand would force millions to continue to work off the books besides immigration obama has used his unilateral authority to act on such hot button issues as gun control health care and global warming however as with other high profile supreme court appeals this term on obamacare abortion rights and affirmative action the outcome here likely will be affected by death in february of justice antonin scalia which left a 4 4 bench split along conservative liberal lines a 4 4 ruling would effectively scuttle the issue until after obama leaves office in nine months and mean at least a temporary setback to his domestic policy legacy even if the justices punt and choose to reargue the case when scalias replacement is sworn in the justices also could not rule narrowly on procedure finding a compromise on a technical issue not directly related to the larger policy questions on the legal side the republican party controlled house filed an amicus brief supporting the states telling the high court the executive does not have the power to authorize let alone facilitate the prospective violation of the immigration laws on a massive class wide scale supporters of the administration vow this issue will resonate in an election year there are millions of families of us born citizens that live under the fear of separation and deportation said ben monterroso executive director of mi familia vota an hispanic advocacy nonprofit our community is watching and will hold accountable those who have stood on the way of our families through the ballots in november mfv and other immigrant rights advocates plan to march at the supreme court around mondays arguments the case is us v texas (15 674) a ruling is expected by late june.,REAL

696,shortly after barack obamas victory in the 2008 presidential election the former chair of the north carolina republican party wrote an anxious postmortem saying something had to be done about the students and black voters whose unprecedented turnout had turned the state blue for the first time in 32 years the alternative the former state chair jack hawke wrote was that the country would “continue to slide toward socialism that “something turned out to be a notorious omnibus law better known to its detractors as the “monster law passed by a republican majority state legislature in 2013 the legislation gutted many of the progressive voting rules that had contributed to obamas razor thin margin in the state same day registration a lengthy early voting period and out of precinct voting by provisional ballot all favored disproportionately by african american voters and students the law also introduced a strict voter id requirement with the anticipated effect of suppressing democratic votes even further had the law stood it could not have been the biggest setback for voting rights in north carolina since the jim crow era a brazen attempt by conservatives to upend the rules of democratic engagement and block access to groups most likely to oppose them the republicans have sought to couch their maneuvering in more benign terms as a form of justifiable partisan warfare hawke noted in his postmortem that the democrats had been motivated united and well financed in 2008 and said it was up to the republicans to respond in kind that argument has come crashing down following a flurry of remarkable court rulings over the past two weeks accusing north carolina and three other republican run states wisconsin kansas and texas of violating the 1965 voting rights act and intentionally discriminating against african americans and other classes of voters state and federal judges have struck down laws that could not have given the republicans a significant edge in close races this november lifting the spirits of voting rights activists who have been campaigning against such laws for more than a decade “winning an election does not empower anyone in any party to engage in purposeful racial discrimination the fourth circuit court of appeals ruled in the north carolina case on friday “when a legislature dominated by one party has dismantled barriers to african american access to the franchise even if done to gain votes politics as usual does not allow a legislature dominated by the other party to re erect those barriers the omnibus law has been almost entirely swept away and is now unlikely to be resurrected in any form before november when hillary clinton and donald trump will be fighting over every vote in north carolina where recent polls show them less than two points apart in kansas which is not a swing state a state court pushed back against an attempt by the states top republican elections official kris kobach to prevent an estimated 17 500 kansans from voting in state and local races even though they have been recognized as eligible by federal courts they will now be allowed to participate fully in primary elections this tuesday in texas also not a swing state a federal appeals court has ordered the state government to find a remedy for eligible voters unable to comply with the countrys single most restrictive and blatantly partisan voter id law a law recognizing concealed carry weapons permits as valid id but not student cards from state universities and in wisconsin which is a swing state the federal courts have delivered a double rebuke to governor scott walker and his contention that one of the countrys most efficiently run election systems was in need of a major overhaul one federal judge ruled last week that eligible voters unable to meet the requirements of the states voter id law could not instead produce an affidavit attesting to their identity on friday a different federal judge struck down much of wisconsins version of the north carolina omnibus law a 2013 act that restricted early voting extended the residency requirement for new voters and denied provisional voters the chance to vote out of precinct “the legislatures immediate goal was to achieve a partisan objective judge james peterson charged in a blistering ruling “but the means of achieving that objective was to suppress the reliably democratic vote of milwaukees african americans taken together these rulings represent a stunning rejection of more than a decade of republican strategy in states where the party has taken control of the legislature the governors mansion or both “the tide is turning against the proponents of voter suppression across our country longtime voting rights activist kirsten clarke of the lawyers committee for civil rights under law said in a statement “it is time for elected officials to see the writing on the wall and abandon efforts to lock americans out of the ballot box bob phillips of common cause north carolina was similarly jubilant “this is a big win he said after the fourth circuit ruling “it affirms that democracy is for everyone republican leaders were either too stunned to offer an immediate response or else accused “activist judges of making an incorrect interpretation of the law despite the gops protestations that it is championing “commonsense safeguards against fraud most political analysts agree that turnout has been a preoccupation as demographic trends move away from the gops overwhelmingly white base it has become obvious over several election cycles that the fewer voters come to the polls the better the party tends to do numerous studies including one by the government accountability office have shown that voter id laws can shave two to three percentage points off democratic turnout a margin that can easily swing a race for the house the senate or the presidency peterson was unable to throw out wisconsins voter id provision entirely because it was upheld by the higher federal courts in 2014 just as indianas was a few years earlier plenty of other obstacles to voter registration and participation remain for example in florida where third party registration drives have all but ceased because of a republican backed law passed in 2011 in other words not every obstacle to voting will be removed across the country before november but the latest rulings nevertheless make life more difficult for the trump campaign especially if the race remains close and states like wisconsin and north carolina prove crucial to his chances the judicial decisions are also likely to affect down ticket races for example in the west texas congressional district where the former democratic representative pete gallego lost his seat by about 2 000 votes in 2014 and now stands a much better chance of winning it back one academic study suggested he lost 10 000 15 000 votes because of the impact of the voter id law bound up in the battle for voting rights is a bigger ideological fight over the legacy of racism in america and the continuing need for legislation to protect certain minorities before 2013 when the supreme court gutted a key provision of the voting rights act north carolina and texas would not have been able to pass their repressive voting laws because they would have been blocked by the justice departments civil rights division at the time the supreme courts chief justice john roberts argued that policing of racism in elections should be determined by “current conditions and that in his view discrimination did meet the “pervasive flagrant widespread and rampant level that had justified the voting rights act in the 1960s that view was sharply contested by ruth bader ginsburg among others and by the rank and file of the north carolina naacp which reacted to the omnibus law by staging weekly protests in the streets known as “moral mondays the rev william barber the head of the north carolina naacp who had a prominent speaking slot at last weeks democratic national convention has described the battle against the new voting laws as “our selma now it seems likely that both the voter id question and the related question of voter discrimination will come back to the supreme court at which point roberts will have to decide whether “current conditions are as upbeat as he assumed in 2013 in the meantime voting rights activists in north carolina and other states will be keeping a hawk eye out for further attempts to restrict voting through disinformation or other time honored means “folks are not going to put their guard down said phillips of common cause “we and others will continue to double down on education to make sure there is no confusion whatever the folks pushed these laws through try to say from here on to election day we will make sure it is accurate not misleading.,REAL

the likes of a former vet and unknown accomplices for the purposes of targeting white people and in particular policethe new judge dredd style execution by robot! doesn t this all sound like a scripted move?immediately given the symbolic title michael x to affiliate the suspect with malcolm x the entire scenario from the revised proclamation of cell terrorist to lone wolf now smells of sub par hollywood script writing especially the ludicrous climax of hidden ieds followed by police deploying a bomb carrying robocop r2d2 like executioner as the only rational means of finally halting the crazed assassinas we will see the event also echoes prior known false flags and staged scenarios as well as fitting a general pattern of soros style color revolutions and agitation propaganda on top of the fact that the evolving official story is preposterouswhile it may appear contradictory at first glance the notion that such an event could not fit the progressive mold of a color revolution is not far fetchedconsortium news details numerous soros funded groups that have called for soft power coups and regime changes through numerous fronts that include social justice causes as well as right wing groups like right sektor in the ukraine 21stcenturywire comments amazingly by late last night and early this morning police chief david brown reported that at least 3 of suspected snipers were already in custodybrown stated early on that he believed the four suspects were working as a unit using long range rifles triangulated at elevated positions at difference places in the downtown area the fourth suspect micah xavier johnson (the media referred to him as micah x to intentionally prompt a malcolm x tone to the event) a military trained marksman and us army veteran was said to be caught in a shoot out with police from the second floor of the el centro parking garage he was upset about black lives matter the recent police shootings he was upset at white people he wanted to kill white people especially police officers brown said (ny post) bizarrely according to police johnson (photo above) was finally summarily executed by police after an unprecedented risk assessment by the dallas police who deployed a robot carrying a bomb chief brown claimed that his officers had no choice but to use the bomb to kill the suspect other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger the political ripple effects of this unlikely and highly improbable event were felt immediately as the mainstream media siege was underway and the politicians began lining up to weigh in and jockey for political position on any number of issue ranging from gun control to race relations and police brutality but also debating the whether or not public marches and demonstrations are indeed safe for the public to attend in the face of this latest security threat on the police side of this dialectic law enforcement are also queuing up to decry the violence against police and calls are omnipresent for increased police powers and security measure in order to combat the rising threat of domestic extremism coincidentally yesterdays event just happened to all on july 7th or 7/7 ala london 7/7 following on that theme the media and law enforcement began floating the term terrorist attack and cnn leading the pack by claiming that dallas 7/7 was the polices worst loss since 9/11

large portion of the total news feed increasingly taking on a clickbait style the endless gender oppression articles are another technology for social re engineering under the guise of appealing to the female populacefemales are undeniably more susceptible to emotional appeals and advertising deception the same marketing styles of ad campaigns for endless hygiene products now mirrors the mindless gender based stories of oppressed trans teens and eternally victimized and oppressed western women (who have the highest living standards in the world) while western women conduct their war on the patriarchal power by sharing these retarded stories on their ipads they are just as much the dupes of the same foundation/think tank techniques as the low iq isis recruits and the ghetto mobson the other side of the dialectic are the equally duped right wingers who still champion the bush dynasty and so called american freedoms the great envy of all the world that must be protected at all costs from an absolutely impossible fabricated foreign invasion by isis constituting the new boogey man in the patriot/tea party mythos the invasion of the western intelligence created and backed isis is the phony bad man parallels the phony bad man of the thugs (the 1% which is actually anyone middle class) and the bad man of the narcissistic american female the patriarchyall of these bad men are invented bad men manufactured and created by the foundations and think tanks to manipulate your specific population niche the establishment has recruited and used dumb low iq prison convert muslim mind controlled bots for decades just as the system has used dumb low iq females as poster children for gender revolution the sniper effect unknown snipers are a classic tactic of western influenced regime changes including romania in 1989 in regard to ceaucescu which is particularly relevant to our situation as the coup there involved a revolt against police sniper death squads in romania aided by western intelligence would thus be a perfect parallel to anti police engineered sniping in dallasother events where snipers were involved in regime change and staged agitprop include the arab spring yeltsins counter government in 1993 venezuela in 2002 thailand in 2010 and more recently kyrgyzstan egypt libya and syria supposed unknown snipers like terrorists provide a useful function for existing regimes or foreign powers to conveniently concoct and steer events by pinning blame on patsiessame strategy of controlled radical opposition in a game of obvious dialecticslike operation gladio where from the 50s to the 80s left wing radicals were blamed for euro terror completely engineered and staged by a covert branch of nato intelligence and p 2 affiliated masonry lodge similar patterns are seen in todays terror cells and lone wolf shooters some wondered why i originally mentioned the masonic apparel in the original post but this is because gladio used p 2 and secret societies can function as networks for organizing and arranging provocateurs much like the muslim brotherhood or isis in short sniping events just like false flags are run by and advantageous to the state not lone wolves and terror cellsindeed it is the same pattern mentioned above domestically with the fbi hatched terror plots terror in these instances functions to exacerbate a strategy of tension to smear opposition promote undue fear and cajole the populace into accepting more surveillance and security theater dallas saw a similarly implausible story last year of conspiracy theorist james boulware a lone wolf shooter who purportedly shot at police after incoherent online ramblings (which are quite clearly manufactured) and now we are told micah x has a manifesto a must have for your daily shooter starter packhighly dubious james boulware dallas shooting fusion drillsas noted in my original video at least two large scale multi agency dhs supervised fusion drills in the dallas ft worth area preceded the 7/7 event by only a week one drill even included three shooters and bombs a narrative now fed into the mainstream media concerning the dallas sniping event given every major terror event of recent recollection has been preceded by a drill of the same scenario it should be obvious to question the dallas event as it fits the same patterns as prior terror the familiar narrative of dallas now includes ieds hidden in mysterious locales a dubious claim inserted into the narrative of james holmes booby trapped apartment for example the date and locale for the event is also suspicious being in the vicinity of the jfk assassination as well as on the anniversary of the london 7/7 bombing another staged eventwe are supposed to believe micah x learned his sniping and ied skills in the military and subsequently coordinated a professional hit man operation to target random white police over the shootings of philando castile and alton sterling that occurred that day! mass media claimed the supposed shooter was angry about events that transpired that day and subsequently had time to perform reconnaissance and establish sniper spots for that days black lives matter protestlunacy does not end there as the standoff with police then involved the preposterous claim of utilizing and bomb bot to blow the suspect up as he supposedly refused to cooperate are bomb bots now standard procedure? were the mainstream narrative of this event true (and it certainly is not) wouldn t law enforcement choose to gas the subject or subdue him to gather information about his so called terror cell? instead the public was fed a fantastical robocop storyline to add tabloid juice to this manufactured event as we have seen in so manypatsies dupes and provocateurs black power groups are notorious for being infiltrated by federal agents and provocateurs and the new black panther party is a shining example allowed to consistently call for the death of all whites (which is illegal) this fake front group is allowed to continue to agitate and play on public fears like other terror groups and racial identity movements like the kkk or elohim city and mcveigh the black power and nation of islam movements have been exposed as phony government fronts many times often identified by their outlandish and outrageous calls for violencemost famously this was seen in the cointelpro operation with fbi informant richard aoki arming the black panthers to make them appear distastefully radicalphoto op patty hearst and the theatrical sla abduction the saul alinsky style approach of manufacturing radicals for self destructive social change that marks this event also has precedent in two other previously contrived terror attacks the alinsky inspired bill ayers weather underground event and patty hearst sla staging both events were manufactured operations that served to solidify mass opinion against anti war movements while the sla event (in which reportedly 6 died while patty hearst was not even in the building) became the basis for americas adoption of swat teams the hearst soap opera kidnapping was even followed by a television show called swat that aided in the rise of americas acceptance of the warrior cop this fact as well as the long term federalization of local police refutes the faux right wing narrative that obama and company are anti cop seen in this light the dallas event is ably summed up in its effectiveness for the establishment by patrick henningsen the dallas shooting is significant on a number of levelsfirstly dallas will further accentuate the artificial divide between what americans perceive as the left or liberal wing of political society and the what is sold as americas right or conservative wing in this dialectic democrat is set against republican young against old black is pitted against white wealthy against poor upper class against middle class and even middle class against lower class in the run up to the presidential election in november this division will be important in order to polarize america along a prefabricated dialectical line and thus keeping the national discourse down at a base or emotional level and through this binary process avoid any real examination of americas fundamental issues policy flaws and the federal governments unsustainable bloated borrow & spend habit effectively kicking the can down the road another 4 years (which seems to be the norm) ultimately this serves the state its bureaucratic stakeholders and the power structure as a whole secondly this event can be used to nudge the left wing and democrat partys own gun control agenda which is being aggressively pursued at the moment this wing of the political establishment has already demonstrated that it has no qualms about using a national incident or tragedy like the orlando shooting as warm pr leverage to push their emergency legislative agenda ironically left wing and black activists will be blamed for this latest act of political violence and will be used in this case to further advance the political lefts own bespoke gun control agenda much to the dismay of conservative america as a result of this staged event carried out by agent provocateurs anti police or anti government african american militant or black power activists will be painted a poor light and effectively marginalized once this process is complete the state can then move in to extend that marginalization to any anti government protests further neutering any real grass roots opposition for what is obviously a rapidly growing police state in the usthirdly this event is being used to increase tension between the public and law enforcement note the differences between the short and the long term narratives at play here in the short term this dallas sniper event is originally designed as a reaction to us police killing poor unarmed black men on the streets of america but in the long term the pendulum will swing back to the state in order to restore law and order thus further consolidating power into a more concentrated police state this is evidenced already by us law enforcement are already rallying in solidarity in an us against them dialectic by placing the nations police as the protagonist and the public as the antagonist pop culture promotion of supposed anti establishment agitation and revolution in reality it is top down social engineering and psychological warfaregiven the government admission that much of modern history has been manipulated and contrived through false flags and staged events is it sensible to take the dallas event at face value? we are constantly reminded in every terror event to never forget 9/11 but a much more apt recollection would be to never forget the admissions and examples of fake and staged news as well as individuals who supposedly die in three separate terror events being still alive show the lunacy of the fact there is no law or regulation upon the government and private infotainment news agencies barring them from manufacturing events rather the pattern 21wire recognized and exposed in the recent andrews air force bases phony live shooter drill gone live scenario serves as the exemplary form of how these events are engineered especially given the drills preceding the 7/7 dallas eventnaturally the alt right will seize upon the event as proof of a racial attack but this simply plays into the establishments desire for a helter skelter race war and a summer of chaos all of which was prepared for symbolically through beyoncs militant black panther super bowl halftime show back in february the race war is not fought with bats and maces in the streets but through the toxic culture itself with its insidious programming for each racial groupas we have seen in past events gun control is once again the unanimous cacophony while the labeling of black lives matter as a terrorist group only serves to set further precedence for anyone critical of the establishment as an extremist or terrorist to hear jays full podcasts see more information and learn how you can become a subscriber to jaysanalysisjay

highest profile address since ending his campaign for president in may and effectively clearing the final hurdle between trump and the nomination cruz then proceeded to tell an emotional story about a police officer slain in the mass shooting in dallas “as i thought about what i wanted to say tonight michael smiths story weighed on my heart he said of the officer “maybe thats because his daughter caroline is about the same age as my eldest daughter and happens to share the same name later on cruz touted policies championed by trump such as building a wall on the us mexico border without mentioning the republican party nominee by name but he also told voters to “vote your conscience in november unlike the many speakers who openly urged attendees to vote for trump the final moments of cruzs speech were some of the most dramatic of this weeks convention while he had received steady cheers early in his speech the crowd grew angrier later on with some loudly shouting that cruz should endorse trump as cruz wrapped up trump made a surprise appearance in the arena heads turned to look at him and distracted from cruzs speech when cruz finished there were loud boos throughout the arena at that instant trump walked down to his family vip box waving to fans and flashing a grin at least one person in the hall posted video of cruzs wife heidi exiting the venue to jeers a coterie of

misunderstood one paragraph that ted cruz who is a superb orator said gingrich told the crowd “and i just want to point it out to you ted cruz said you can vote your conscience for anyone who will uphold the constitution in this election there is only one candidate who will uphold the constitution so … to paraphrase ted cruz if you want to protect the constitution of the united states the only

fighter a real fighter can take a punch to the face get up and congratulate the man who beat him in a fair fight a sore loser is never appreciated he said rep steve king (r iowa) one of cruzs leading supporters in the primary took a different view “they were chanting trump in the face of cruz and then donald came down and totally distracted from cruz the atmosphere that could not ve been created by a well crafted speech was ruined florida gov rick scott kicked off the speeches earlier in the evening advancing an argument that democrats have failed the country across a range of issues “today america is in terrible world record high debt he said “our economy is not growing our jobs are going overseas we have allowed our military to decay and we project weakness on the international stage

52,donald trump continues to lead his rivals nationally in the contest for the republican presidential nomination but his hold on the republican party electorate has weakened since the primary season began and the party is now deeply divided over his candidacy according to a new washington post abc news poll trump maintains the support of 34 percent of registered republicans and republican leaning independents compared with 25 percent for sen ted cruz of texas 18 percent for sen marco rubio of florida and 13 percent for ohio gov john kasich trumps margin over cruz has narrowed from 16 points in january to nine today as a succession of republican candidates quit the race cruzs position has ticked up four points since january rubios has risen by seven and kasichs has grown by 11 trumps has dipped by three points within the polls margin of sampling error in the democratic race former secretary of state hillary clinton still leads sen bernie sanders of vermont but her national margin is the smallest in a post abc poll since the beginning of the campaign the new poll shows clinton as the favorite of 49 percent of registered democrats and democratic leaning independents compared with sanders whose support is at 42 percent that seven point lead for clinton compares with her 19 point advantage in january that trump is a polarizing figure within the republican party is no surprise and it is typified by the opposition among establishment and other republicans that has intensified over the past few weeks only a bare majority (51 percent) of republicans or republican leaning independents say they would be satisfied with the new york billionaire as their nominee a noticeably smaller percentage than for cruz (65 percent) or rubio (62 percent) with kasich in between at 56 percent favorable ratings also indicate an increasingly tenuous standing within the party in early january republicans clearly gave trump more favorable than unfavorable reviews 60 percent to 39 percent that has narrowed to a 53 46 margin with negative marks at their highest level in post abc polling since trump entered the race his positive ratings also trail cruzs 64 percent and rubios 63 percent the post abc poll finds that more than half of republicans and republican party leaning independents think trump is dishonest does not understand their problems lacks the right experience and does not have the right personality and temperament to be an effective president by contrast more than 6 in 10 republicans say cruz is honest empathetic and has the right temperament and experience; similar shares say rubio has the first three qualities while half say he has the right experience in a hypothetical head to head test of strength between trump and cruz republicans say they prefer the senator by 54 percent to 41 percent rubio is a narrower favorite in a one on one test against trump with an edge of 51 percent to 45 percent the survey did not test a trump kasich face off the poll was conducted over a weekend in which cruz won contests in kansas and maine trump won in louisiana and kentucky and rubio won in puerto rico on tuesday republicans are voting in michigan mississippi idaho and hawaii next tuesday the first day states can award delegates on a winner take all basis there will be contests in florida ohio illinois missouri and north carolina by the end of that day more than half of the 2 472 convention delegates will have been awarded it is likely that after those march 15 contests republicans will have the clearest sense yet of trumps overall strength and of the viability of his challengers cruzs string of recent victories including in his home state of texas a week ago have elevated him as the leading rival to trump if rubio and kasich don t win their home states they will face pressure to quit the race many now predict that the republican contest will not be resolved before the national convention in july but even many republicans who say they would not be satisfied with trump as the nominee appear uneasy about the efforts of party leaders to prevent him from winning about half of all republicans who are dissatisfied or only “somewhat satisfied with trump nonetheless oppose efforts by party leaders to prevent him from becoming the nominee there is considerable talk now about a possible floor fight at the convention should trump arrive with the most delegates but lacking the 1 237 needed for a first ballot victory about 42 percent of republican voters support other candidates and say that in such a situation the party should pick another nominee but 53 percent either support trump or say that leading the delegate count even if short of an outright majority should guarantee victory among all americans trump has a more negative image by far compared to cruz rubio or clinton two in 3 adults say they have an unfavorable impression of trump who has drawn controversy in recent months for attacks on illegal immigrants from mexico sen john mccain of arizona fox news anchor megyn kelly a disabled reporter and muslims among other targets none of the three other candidates tested clinton cruz and rubio had a net positive image but all were viewed more favorably than trump among all adults 52 percent say they see clinton unfavorably 51 percent see cruz negatively and 45 percent have a negative impression of rubio clinton and rubio have the least negative image overall the new post abc survey shows a huge gender gap in support for trumps candidacy he leads among republican men with 44 percent a roughly 2 1 margin over second place cruz among republican women though he is the favorite of just 24 percent in january his support among republican party women stood at 37 percent compared to 15 percent for cruz trump also has lost ground against cruz among very conservative republicans and among those with incomes less than 50000 dollars matched against his remaining rivals trump continues to perform slightly better among republicans without college degrees than among those who are university graduates although he has an edge with both groups he has a wider lead among voters younger than 50 than with older voters among white evangelical christians trump narrowly trails cruz but among non evangelicals and white catholics his lead is almost 2 to 1 matched directly against cruz though trump loses voters with or without college degrees voters who see themselves as working class and middle class and those with higher or lower incomes trump also loses conservatives against cruz especially those who say they are “very conservative while the two tie among moderate and liberal republicans overall americans remain deeply pessimistic about the federal government two in 3 offer negative reactions including about a fifth who describe themselves as angry trump has tapped into that mood the more dissatisfied that people are with the federal government the more likely they are to support his candidacy a similarly strong majority sees the political system today as dysfunctional even slightly more so than in the fall trump does best among those who feel most strongly about the way the system works more americans by far say they favor someone with experience in the system as the next president rather than someone from outside the political establishment republicans though tilt more toward an outsider among those who want someone from the outside trump has the support of nearly half among those looking for someone with experience trump runs fourth behind cruz rubio and kasich a similar pattern holds for two of trumps most controversial ideas deporting all of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants living in the united states and temporarily banning muslims from entering the country as a security precaution overall americans oppose both proposals though more republicans favor than oppose them trump has big leads among those who support such policies but those leads

devoted husband (“pat doesn t have a mink coat… but i tell her she looks good in anything); father of two darling daughters; public servant barely getting by on his government salary and borrowing a tactic from fdr he made his dog checkers the most famous cocker spaniel in america in closing he urged republicans to write or wire their national committee about whether he should stay or go the response was overwhelmingly positive and nixon at 39 eventually became the second youngest vice president in history so he had nothing to fear about debating john f kennedy unfortunately he was not at his best that september night campaigning in north carolina earlier he had banged his knee on a car door ignored the continuing discomfort and wound up in walter reed hospital with an infection that took him from the campaign for several weeks after recovering he rushed to catch up caught a cold which he ignored and entered the television studio underweight pale and feverish he looked terrible especially when contrasted with sen kennedy who was tanned and rested immediately his advantage as the experienced vice president disappeared replaced by a man obviously nervous perspiring seemingly unready for the presidency narrowly defeated by kennedy nixon learned from his mistakes as the republican presidential nominee in 1968 nixon chose not to debate his democratic opponent vice president hubert humphrey instead under the tutelage of media guru roger ailes he used television brilliantly appearing in a series of campaign appearance dubbed “the man in the arena in which nixon answered softball questions from friendly audiences he won four years later running for re election he rejected sen george mcgoverns call for a debate and never again subjected himself to that kind of format taking office when nixon resigned gerald ford the first unelected vice president to succeed to the presidency could not not avoid a debate in the post watergate america of 1976 it proved to be his undoing stung by his pardon of richard nixon and faced with rising inflation and a weak economy ford stumbled badly during his second debate with gov jimmy carter discussing soviet american relations he remarked that russia did not dominate eastern europe and never would “under a ford administration immediately recognizing fords gaffe carter grinning like the cheshire cat said that the presidents statement would surprise polish and czech americans whose relatives lived behind the iron curtain in the days that followed ford tried to clarify his remarks but the damage was done carter was on his way to the white house and so it went in succeeding elections whoever won the debate won the presidency political junkies will recall those moments the year 1988 michael dukakiss tepid response when asked if he would “favor an irrevocable death penalty for a man who had brutally raped and murdered his wife kitty “no i don t bernard he replied softly to cnns bernard shaw “and i think you know that i ve opposed the death penalty during all my life the journalist roger simon later recalled the reactions of his colleagues in the press room “hes through “thats all she wrote “get the hook they were right dukakis now appearing to be a bloodless technocrat lost to george hw bush in 1992 it was bushs turn to stumble debating bill clinton and ross perot bush seemed indifferent to a questioner from the audience who had been harmed by the recession the cameras caught him looking at his watch (he later admitted thinking “only 10 more minutes of this crap) clinton immediately sensed an opportunity and moved closer to the woman seeking more information about how she was faring in hard times clintons empathy won the night and the presidency but it is the 1980 campaign that bears the closest resemblance to todays clinton trump contest president jimmy carter badly weakened by economic woes and his failure to win the release of the american hostages held captive by the iranians for almost a year faced gov ronald reagan whom many thought too conservative and hawkish to become president carter went further imitating lbjs attacks on his 1964 opponent barry goldwater he painted reagan as reckless and dangerous his anti russian mania a threat to national security “reagan will lead us into war carter claimed as the campaign drew to a close carters vitriolic rhetoric created another problem for the beleaguered president the press began to attack him as an extremist the embodiment of “meanness the turning point came during carter and reagans debate in cleveland ohio on october 28 1980 as the two men went to their podiums carter aide vernon jordan became immediately alarmed “i didn t like what i saw jordan later recalled “reagan looked relaxed smiling robust;

1576,prometheus brings fire to man(image by friedrich fuger) license district of columbia i have been accused by another contributor at oen of advocating violent resistance against the us government so i need to address this issue in a comment on an anti war article by david swanson i stated clearly that i am not a violent revolutionary because peace has to begin somewhere and the only place i have real control is with myself so i accept the principle that a peace and an anti war position begins with me but what does taking a serious peace position mean? many years ago more than once i protested and marched with martin luther king jr for peace and justice at home and abroad (vietnam) i paid for this with threats on my life a broken wrist and a fractured occipital bone a man i knew at the time told me that if i had cut my hair and stayed at home or just gone to a baseball game or some other proper american activity instead of walking the street and asking for trouble i would never have suffered those threats and injuries he said that i was the one who caused the violence and in a way he was right when mlk decided to organize protests and marches he was asking for trouble and he knew it better than anyone when he was talking and marching about racial equality and against war he was risking the possibility of injury or death but when he moved to chicago to live with the poor and began openly demanding changes in the economic system that risk possibility became a certainty from that decision on there was a bullet with his name on it many people suffered threats injury and sometimes death because of mlk he caused a great deal of violence because he was serious about radically changing the socio economic system he lived in and knew the change would never come if he simply wrote letters to his congressman and restricted his activity to baseball games and other proper things when bobby kennedy decided to begin dismantling the cia he was asking for big trouble and he got it murder poor man should have just stuck to baseball games flag waving and ineffective idealistic speeches or he and king should have just dropped out of public view and retreated into an eastern monastery anonymously meditated for the rest of their lives and let karma take care of everything because taking a serious position in the world (outside a monastery) is just asking for trouble as in violence advertisement when i was a teenager there was a huge popular wave of anti christian and pro hindu sentiment among mostly white young people in the us india was endlessly referred to as the true holy land in which rose the true holy men all western saints were just shallow pretenders i was always troubled and alienated by this partly because i had some knowledge of the history of india and was quite aware of its age long atrocious poverty and class discrimination reality i was amazed at the fact that hip kids in the us would rant about poverty and injustice and class distinction in the us and simply ignore these realities in india because there were these bearded beaded gurus in lotus position samadhi transcendence in india very strange reality disconnect i never bought it and it took me years of academic study and self examination to see how deep this doubt on my part really went i finally realized that i actually saw the transcendental hindu philosophy of india as itself being ethically lacking in some essential way that i had difficulty articulating to myself it wasn t a matter of political activity by this time i had already realized that i was an anarchist and rejected political structures on principle because they were inevitably hierarchical and therefore gave powers and rights to a few people and denied these powers and rights to the rest of the people my rejection of india and its spiritual philosophy wasn t political it went deeper than that then it suddenly hit me that indias poverty was a blazing symbol of indias denial of the reality and value of the material world it simply didn t matter that masses of people lived in nightmare poverty i was a child in the roman catholic church and i took it very seriously i took jesus christ very seriously i took all of christian mythology very seriously i thought and felt and evaluated all things in life in terms of this mythology then something began to happen that caused some major cracks in the walls of my cathedral world i began to get a sense a tormenting sense that there was some sort of core contradiction in the whole thing i started becoming very uneasy about this unimaginably big guy called god it wasn t that i doubted that he was there (somewhere) it was more that i was profoundly troubled about what it was exactly that he was up to i mean what was all this really about? i was a serious theology student even as a young man and this is the problem i ran into if god was infinite eternal omniscient omnipotent and perfect in every possible way then what was the point of me? i was completely unnecessary because everything was already perfect and me? i was unimaginably far away from perfect so what was the point of me? i was like an infinitesimal stain on perfection and i couldn t erase myself i could not only hope that god would tolerate me forever and the idea that i was loved by god precisely because i was a miserable and hopelessly imperfect little sinner was actually more disgusting and terrifying than it was affirming i mean what the hell was going on? why was i created? i was sure that i knew exactly how frankensteins monster felt and i began to sense what i would later think of as the blind cruelty of the transcendent let me explain one more thing before i return to the original question of revolutionary violence the story of the resurrection and ascension of jesus christ in christian mythology is very peculiar if one looks at it very closely i am not referring merely to the claim that someone actually rose from the dead it goes beyond that please look at this with me the mythology claims that jesus rose from the dead physically and showed himself to his disciples who saw and heard and touched him physically it was a physical body addressing them then this physical body began to do things that physical bodies can t ordinarily do it moved through physical walls without doing any damage to itself or the wall then it finally ascended that is it disappeared leaving absolutely nothing physical behind the ordinary explanation for this in christian teaching is that the body of christ was spiritualized but if that is the correct explanation then why was it ever physical or material to begin with? why did jesus bother to rise from the grave physically at all if he was only going to spiritualize in the end? for that matter what was the point of imperfect material creation at all if its destiny is only to return into pure spirit in the end? it is not only senseless it is downright perverse it is a grotesquerie that has no point the material world has a point in itself or it doesn t and if it doesn t then why is it even here? and if it does then we need to become conscious of what its point is the frequently expressed opinion that we are really spiritual beings who are just here in the material world to learn is nonsense to which i say learn what? how to be spiritual? if we are meant to be learning how to be spiritual then we should have stayed spiritual and if we are learning how to be material then material existence has a meaning in itself that is not just spiritual and if material existence has meaning in itself then we need to learn how to guard the sanctity of material existence which means that it is not acceptable that people force other people into poverty or into war or into any form of material deprivation or abuse we material revolutionaries fight for the sanctity of material existence to fight for this means to stand up physically and if standing up physically leads to violence then that is the price we pay for doing what is right and to deny the sanctity of the material world is to render it absurd and therefore to render reality absurd advertisement i do not advocate any initiation of violence but if violence comes to us for standing up for human material dignity then we accept it and we persist until we triumph or until death lays us down to suffer woes which hope thinks infinite; to forgive wrongs deeper than death or night; to defy power which seems omnipotent;.,FAKE

team of experts from the four corners of the earth focusing on international relations issues and crises they focus on analysis and intelligence of the ongoing crises and the biggest stories from around the world ukraine the war in middle east central asia issues protest movements in the balkans migration crises and others in addition they provide military operations analysis the military posture of major world powers and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations we try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media deterioration of interracial relations during barack obamas presidency by south front on october 27 2016 …from southfront inter racial conflict in the us continues to escalate despite the fact that a black president has been leading the country for 8 years all of the various ethnic groups that comprise american society hoped that barack obama would be able to “sew together the fabric of a nation torn by racial and social divisions but racism is still on the rise this poses a significant threat to us homeland security government institutions and big business continue to be controlled by the white elites and the perilous social situation of ethnic minorities continues to be accompanied by an increase in crime this causes growing racial intolerance at all levels people are frustrated by the lack of change in inter racial relations which has led to a new round of racial violence the most striking example of the exacerbation of racial conflict is the situation prevailing around so called police violence every case of the killing of an unarmed african american in recent years becomes an occasion for demonstrations which very often degenerate into riots the new mass protest movements are thriving and growing in influence aided by social media for example “black lives matter which is compared to the black panthers of the 70s despite the lack of talented leaders and clear programs in such associations their ongoing radicalization is evident that was demonstrated by the riots in ferguson of 2014 and the case of the murder of police officers in baton rouge the indignation of the colored population at police actions is justified the level of police violence in the united states is quite high it is known that american cops kill 5 times more people than canadian police 40 times more than german police and 140 times more than police in england and wales all segments of the american population are suffering from a disproportionate use of force by police according to the resource “mapping police violence from the 1st of january 2013 to the 31st of december 2015 3 486 people were killed by police or approximately 1100 people per year of these 571 were hispanic (16%) 949 african american (27%) and 1522 (43%) were white these figures must be compared to the fact that whites are 64% of the us population african americans are 13% of the overall population while 16% are hispanic however the divergent behavior of the white population is much rarer due to a higher level of income and social stability of course most of those killed by police were carrying weapons and the lives of the policemen were in danger but it is generally thought that us cops are more willing to open fire on people of color because the policemen believe that the level of criminality and readiness for violence of hispanics and african americans is much higher additional factors which lead to an increase in racial tensions are racial prejudices and the established practice of cops consistently being acquitted by the us court system largely because of the actions of the us ruling elites there now exists a group of people who are above the law whose members have a license to kill shooting at unarmed people including children and teens beating of pregnant women shooting at people with disabilities and other “controversial actions of american cops all are commonplace occurrences in the united states the members of the committee on the elimination of racial discrimination (cerd) noted that in the united states there exists such inhumane methods as testing experimental medicines on inmates (predominantly african american) in prisons the forced sterilization of minority women and numerous incidents of police abuse of power directed towards the non white population however the increased use of cameras amongst both the civilian population and police departments has facilitated increasingly frequent recordings of such cases of violence and has helped in gaining them publicity that increased awareness that in turn has led to the outrage of the african american population many us police forces continue to subject african americans to more thorough searches and more forceful tactics during arrests unofficially they explain these practices by referring to statistical data presented by such sources as american renaissance and daily stormer for example blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder and eight times more likely to commit robbery they are also three times more likely to use a hand gun and twice more likely to use a knife a number of police officers believe that “special attention to african american citizens improves crime detection rates however it has a significant impact on the rise in police dissatisfaction although the number of attacks on police and their killings has declined in recent years experts explain it by the fact that us police are increasingly avoiding “black neighborhoods where they can be particularly vulnerable moreover a large part of the us population is puzzled with the public position of president obama who invariably condemns the actions of the police and grieves for the black victims of police violence but is silent about the cases of murder of police officers in the course of discharging their official responsibilities such a situation leads to an increase in real crime which is not reflected in official statistics we should not forget that the number of firearms in the united states recently surpassed the number of inhabitants and according to various estimates there are more than 320 million guns in the us of which more than 270 million are in the hands of the civilian population therefore a further escalation of violence in the american society at any time can lead to very dire consequences in general ethnic tensions peaked since the beginning of the barack obama presidency thus according to the official fbi statistics in 2015 the number of white on black murders and vice versa reached their highest levels in 2008 the number of white on black murders has increased by 12% while the number of black on white murders increased 22% according to the report of the chair rapporteur of the united nations working group of experts on people of african descent ricardo iii sunga (philippines) the us maintains “structural racism it is a correct assessment of the situation despite the fact that the police officers are under the special protection of the state laws aimed at fighting race discrimination have the opposite effect of reverse discrimination harming ordinary americans the use of unofficial but very real quotas for the appointment of people of color at schools and businesses sometimes does not allow qualified “white experts to get jobs or promotion in case of conflicts of a civil nature between people with different skin color they are usually subjected to racial profiling at the same time public opinion and the supreme court often find themselves on the side of national minorities on the other hand the us still has a low level of political representation of ethnic minorities as of november 2015 there have been a total of 1 963 members of the united states senate but only nine have been black including barack obama out of 10 884 us representatives only 131 have been black at present there are no black governors at all this lack of political representation also leads to more social tension no improvement has been observed during the final year of the first us african american presidency instead considerable aggravation of interracial conflict has been noted to the point of it becoming one of the most dangerous threats to homeland security obama failed to cope with social problems although he managed to stabilize the economy following the crisis still 27% of african americans continue to live below the poverty line an average of 12% do not have steady employment in some cities this figure reaches 40% and even as high as 50% the level of culture education and labor skills is also low all this leads to an increase in crime among african americans and thus foments racist sentiment in society at large this also leads to an exacerbation of black on black crime for example in chicago over the past 3 years 75% of murder victims are young black males and 72% of murder perpetrators are also young black males social conditions in such places are affected by the fact that a large percentage of children grow up in broken homes as far as inter party competition is concerned it is obvious that in spite of the election of a black president the democrats failed to improve the lives of african americans their criticism of the gops harsh race rhetoric in order to attract voters this is also an attempt to hide the fact they are not interested in changing the status quo paradoxically only republicans with their strict “law and order approach are truly interested in the implementation of certain changes although the consequences of their policies in the event of capturing the white house remain to be seen summing up president obamas activities in the sphere of interracial relations we can say that he has not developed a new national idea in order to deal with the problem of racism us history will remember the first black president not as an idealist

1605,can normal transistors act like a qubit? page 1 link hi i guess i have a question relating to quantum computing since qubits are what makes up quantum computers that being a qubits can act like a transistor that can be either on off or both on and off at the same time in usual computing transistors are either on or off in quantum they can be both on and off at the same time the question i have is simply this is it possible to make a transistor that can act as on off and on and off at the same time even if you had to add an extra layer of circuitry to get that same reading from that single transistor? i mean a normal transistor operate that if it gets no voltage or low voltage then the transistor is in an off state if it gets a certain voltage it is in an on state couldn t you make the voltage extra high to get a both on/off at the same time state? or half voltage to get the same on/off state at the same time to essentially create a fake qubit scenario? there might have to be additional transistors to help make sure of that determination of a transistor appearing in an on/off state but couldn t it be possible? perhaps a circuit of transistors could not determine whether the proceeding transistor should act as both on/off by checking the voltage some how? idk please answer me like i m a drunk stupid idiot perhaps laymen terms? i can be quite the idiot sometimes thanks for hearing me out i m currently drunk and just pondering things link a reply to darage i m sure we could not do weird stuff with circuitry to store more than one bit of data in the circuit but that doesn t really give an advantage over just storing more bits with our conventional technology (which has been highly refined) the advantage of the qbit isn t really that it stores more information it is that it can be used to process more information at the same time quantum + computing = quantum computing the key features of an ordinary computer bits registers logic gates algorithms and so on have analogous features in a quantum computer instead of bits a quantum computer has quantum bits or qubits which work in a particularly intriguing way where a bit can store either a zero or a 1 a qubit can store a zero a one both zero and one or an infinite number of values in between and be in multiple states (store multiple values) at the same time! if that sounds confusing think back to light being a particle and a wave at the same time schrödingers cat being alive and dead or a car being a bicycle and a bus a gentler way to think of the numbers qubits store is through the physics concept of superposition (where two waves add to make a third one that contains both of the originals) if you blow on something like a flute the pipe fills up with a standing wave a wave made up of a fundamental frequency (the basic note you re playing) and lots of overtones or harmonics (higher frequency multiples of the fundamental) the wave inside the pipe contains all these waves simultaneously they re added together to make a combined wave that includes them all qubits use superposition to represent multiple states (multiple numeric values) simultaneously in a similar way just as a quantum computer can store multiple numbers at once so it can process them simultaneously instead of working in serial (doing a series of things one at a time in a sequence) it can work in parallel (doing multiple things at the same time) only when you try to find out what state it is actually in at any given moment (by measuring it in other words) does it collapse into one of its possible states and that gives you the answer to your problem estimates suggest a quantum computers ability to work in parallel would make it millions of times faster than any conventional computer if only we could not build it! so how would we do that? explainthatstuffcom if i understand correctly a quantum computer will just be a smaller more energy efficient version of a massive parallel computer.,FAKE

145,waking times the political system we have today is not the democratic republic it pretends to be national elections are orchestrated public relations events engineered to serve the complex interests of the plutocracy and shadow government the perception of differences between major party candidates is limited to within a narrow spectrum of mainstream ideology and voting has become a tool used by the oligarchy to routinely refresh the illusions of choice and consent indoctrinated to believe this system is mandatory for human prosperity and security consideration of alternatives is practically unthinkable to the citizenry most have their entire lives and fortunes invested in this game and as such a truth this heavy is simply too much to process and too painful to accept obedience and compliance to state and culture have their sleepy comfortable perks but the natural inclination of the human spirit is to gravitate towards truth and freedom when this is ignored or denied inner peace is impossible and outer chaos inevitable for this the free thinker will always emerge as the winner in a contest against the statist for it is the soul who needs no illusions and carries no attachments which can look upon the ashes of ruin and give them credit for being the first signs of new bloom now that the unbelievable spectacle of election 2016 is complete here are some critical things that free thinkers can take away from this rather insane and revelatory experience 1) the mainstream corporate media is unashamedly here to convince and distract you not to inform or empower you most media outlets including many alternative outlets have fully exposed themselves as partisan organizations with no commitment to objectivity or logic we are at last free from the chokehold of this organized form of propaganda and ideological occupation 2) people still do not yet understand the true nature of government as an organization which derives its power and authority from the superior application of violence they don t yet fully understand that in order for government to offer a solution to a problem it must first create that very problem many are still unready to admit that we are ruled by a plutocratic oligarchical corporate state that does not take orders from elected politicians because of this there are now plenty of opportunities to inspire and awaken people with serious information 3) social chaos and mindless incivility has been properly revealed as a reflection of inner chaos fear and disharmony it is clear now that many have been trained to

822,(before it is news) this article was written by michael snyder and originally published at economic collapse blog editors comment in particular with electronic voting the opportunity to flip votes and steal elections is almost unstoppable and will be very difficult to hold accountable nonetheless that is exactly what activists in texas and other key states should focus on after decades of solid “red state status they are now talking openly about hillary winning the lone star state and flipping it blue… despite being perhaps the most despised unlikable and untrustworthy presidential candidate in modern history take a look at the electoral college and the shades of blue and red states as things have been… if team hillary is able to steal texas there will be no way for trump to win 270 electoral college even if he wins ohio florida pennsylvania and other swing states perhaps this has been their secret weapon all along and the reason that she has been so arrogant throughout the entire campaign these are dangerous times and the establishment after systematically denying the voice of the people on many fronts is now making a huge gamble at holding onto power even in the face of obvious fraud will there be any legitimacy left in this country? and what happens if/when this election is stolen and everyone knows it? it is happening again! voting machines are switching votes from donald trump to hillary clinton by michael snyder is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? just a few weeks ago i issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen early voting has already begun in many states and a number of voters in texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from donald trump to hillary clinton the odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight republican ticket if hillary clinton is declared the winner of the state of texas on election night a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted because there is no way that donald trump should lose that state i have said that it will be the greatest miracle in us political history if donald trump wins this election but without the state of texas donald trump has exactly zero chance of winning so those living down in texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote most americans don t realize this but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election the state of ohio was considered to be the key to mitt romneys chances of winning in 2012 and right up to election day the romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state unfortunately for romney something funny was going on with the voting machines in a previous article i included a quote from an ohio voter that had her vote switched from mitt romney to barack obama three times … “i don t know if it happened to anybody else or not but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me said marion ohio voter joan stevens stevens said that when she voted it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for romney “i went to vote and i got right in the middle of romneys name stevens told fox news saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the white house she said that the first time she pushed “romney the machine marked “obama so she pushed romney again obama came up again then it happened a third time “maybe you make a mistake once but not three times she told fox news and we did see some very very strange numbers come out of certain areas of ohio four years ago for example there were more than 100 precincts in cuyahoga county in which barack obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012 if that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough but the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren t even worth mentioning and of course this didn t just happen in ohio similar things were happening all over the country the reason why i bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern if a fair vote had been conducted romney may have indeed won in 2012 and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again in wichita county texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from trump to clinton that it made the local newspaper … shortly after early voting booths opened monday in wichita county rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party republican ticket but their presidential nomination was switched to the democratic nominee hilary clinton none of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand a bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in arlington saw her votes “switched the post was shared more than 100 000 times monday and paul joseph watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines one of the examples that he cited was a facebook post by lisa houlette of amarillo texas … gary and i went to early vote today…i voted a straight republican ticket and as i scrolled to submit my ballot i noticed that the republican straight ticket was highlighted however the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! i tried to go back and change and could not not get it to work i asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn t get it to go back either it took a second election person to get the machine to where i could not correct the vote to a straight ticket be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! don t hesitate to ask for help i had to have help to get mine changed i don t know about you but major alarm bells went off in my head when i read that a similar incident was reported on facebook by shandy clark of arlington texas … hey everyone just a heads up! i had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight republican she checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to clinton! she reported it and made sure her vote was changed back they commented that it had been happening she is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share just want everyones vote to be accurate and count check your vote before you submit! and of course they weren t the only ones reporting vote switching it turns out that lots of other texans have also experienced this phenomenon … so is there a serious problem with the voting machines? according to breitbart one county in texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots… chambers county election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight ticket voters chambers county clerk heather hawthorne told breitbart texas tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a “software update on es&s machines that otherwise “omit one race when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party the texas 14 th court of appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch lets keep a very close eye on this if the state of texas ends up in trumps column on election night perhaps no harm has been done but if trump loses texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else despite what the mainstream media is saying the truth is that election fraud is very real just the other day wnd published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states and devvy kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are “no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate“… in 2012 the highly respected pew research center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote close to 3 million registered in multiples states approximately 24 million one of every eight voter registrations in the united states are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate more than 18 million deceased individuals are listed as voters approximately 275 million people have registrations in more than one state but despite everything you just read the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process in fact just today cnn came out with an article entitled “ poll most see a hillary clinton victory and a fair count ahead “… almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think hillary clinton will win the presidency next month but most say that if that happens donald trump will not accept the results and concede according to a new cnn/orc poll americans overall are more confident that the nations votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008 whatever the outcome however nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner unfortunately cnn does not have much credibility left at this point and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media and the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the russians have made it up … us intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to russias intelligence services could not try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said however that the us election system is so large diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the nov 8 election but hackers could not post documents some of which might be falsified that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud the officials said now that is a real “conspiracy theory and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn t so serious during this election season if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area please report it the american people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us and lets watch the state of texas very carefully if it goes blue you will know that something has gone terribly terribly wrong.,FAKE

4197,sulaimania/baghdad (reuters) a senior iranian military commander repeatedly warned kurdish leaders in northern iraq to withdraw from the oil city of kirkuk or face an onslaught by iraqi forces and allied iranian backed fighters kurdish officials briefed on the meetings said major general qassem soleimani commander of foreign operations for irans elite revolutionary guards traveled to iraqs kurdistan region to meet kurdish leaders at least three times this month before the baghdad governments lightning campaign to recapture territory across the north the presence of soleimani on the frontlines highlights tehrans heavy sway over policy in iraq and comes as shi ite iran seeks to win a proxy war in the middle east with its regional rival and us ally sunni saudi arabia soleimani met leaders from the patriotic union of kurdistan (puk) one of the two main kurdish political parties in northern iraq in the city of sulaimania the day before iraqi prime minister haider al abadi ordered his forces to advance on kirkuk according to a puk lawmaker briefed on the meeting his message was clear withdraw or risk losing tehran as a strategic ally abadi has all the regional powers and the west behind him and nothing will stop him from forcing you to return back to the mountains if he decides so the lawmaker quoted soleimani as telling the puk leadership the iranian general evoked late iraqi president saddam husseins massive attack on a kurdish rebellion in 1991 when almost the entire kurdish population fled northern iraq to the mountains the puk lawmaker said soleimanis visit was to give a last minute chance for the decision makers not to commit a fatal mistake said the lawmaker who like others interviewed in this story declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue commanders of the iraqi kurdish forces known as the peshmerga have accused iran of orchestrating the shi ite led iraqi central governments push into areas under their control a charge senior iranian officials have denied but iran has made no secret of its presence in iraq tehrans military help is not a secret anymore you can find general soleimanis pictures in iraq everywhere said an official close to iranian president hassan rouhani now beside political issues kirkuks oil is a very key element for iran which is an opec member control of those oil fields by irans enemies would be disastrous for us why should we let them enter the oil market? kirkuk fell to iraqi government forces on monday their offensive followed a referendum last month in which the semi autonomous kurdistan region voted to secede from iraq against baghdads wishes kurds have sought an independent state for almost a century after colonial powers divided up the middle east after the fall of the ottoman empire and left kurdish populated territory split between turkey iran iraq and syria but iraqs two main kurdish parties have been at odds over both the referendum and the approach to the crisis in kirkuk which the kurds consider to be the heart of their homeland the puk a close ally of iran accused its rival the kurdistan democratic party (kdp) of putting the kurds at risk of military intervention and isolation by pushing hard for the vote which won wide approval for independence soleimani has been allied to the puk for years but the referendum has drawn him even closer to kurdish politics and expanded irans reach in iraq beyond the baghdad government the iranian general is no stranger to conflicts in iraq which fought an eight year war with iran in the 1980s he has often been seen in footage from the frontlines and iran has long helped baghdad to carry out its military strategy through paramilitary shi ite militias which it funds and arms before the referendum soleimani suggested to kurdish leaders that holding a vote on secession which iran feared would encourage its own kurdish population to agitate for greater autonomy would be risky the iranians were very clear they have been very clear that there will be conflict that these territories will be lost said one prominent iraqi kurdish politician who met soleimani ahead of the sept 25 referendum on oct 6 barely a week after the vote soleimani attended the funeral of puk leader jalal talabani again he wanted to make sure even his closest kurdish allies understood the dangers of not withdrawing from kirkuk officials said a senior iranian diplomat in iraq and an official in iran close to supreme leader ayatollah ali khameneis office said soleimani met with kurdish leaders after talibanis funeral and urged them to withdraw from kirkuk and in exchange tehran would protect their interests soleimani met with one of talabanis sons bafel a few days after his father was buried one of the puk officials said soleimani said abadi should be taken very seriously you should understand this the official said an iranian source in iraq said soleimani was in kirkuk two nights before the iraqi government offensive for a couple of hours to give military guidance iraqi intelligence sources said tehran senator a clear signal to the puk we understand from our sources on the ground that neighboring iran played a decisive role in making the puk chose the right course with baghdad one iraqi intelligence official told reuters tensions over the referendum and kirkuk have deepened divisions between the two main political parties in northern iraq the kdp accused the puk of betraying the kurdish cause by capitulating to iran and striking a deal to withdraw the talabani clan were behind the offensive on kirkuk they asked qassem (soleimani) for help and his troops were there on the ground said a source close to massoud barzani president of the kurdistan regional government and head of the kdp it is becoming clear that iran is directing the operations to destroy the kdp the puk strongly denies this talabanis son bafel accused the kdp of missing a zero hour chance to avoid losing kirkuk by failing to reach a deal over a military base which iraqi government forces had demanded to take back unfortunately we reacted too slowly and we find ourselves where we are today bafel told reuters two other kurdish political sources gave a similar account iran and soleimani offered early assistance to northern iraqs kurds in the fight against islamic state a rallying point for the kurdish community but after the devastating loss of kirkuk iraqi kurds have been left disillusioned they (both puk and kdp leaders) just make decisions on their own and play with peoples lives in the end we pay the price said pensioner abdullah ahmed in sulaimania this is a disaster for everyone everyone was united against daesh (islamic state) now they are back just looking out for themselves.,REAL

1020,donald trump praised vladimir putin and hillary clinton defended her 2003 vote for war in iraq in a televised q&a wednesday on national security democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton with today show co anchor matt lauer left speaks at the nbc commander in chief forum held at the intrepid sea air and space museum aboard the decommissioned aircraft carrier intrepid new york wednesday sept 7 2016 donald trump and hillary clinton confronted their key weaknesses in a televised national security forum with the republican defending his preparedness to be commander in chief despite vague plans for tackling global challenges and the democrat arguing that her controversial email practices did not expose questionable judgment mr trump also renewed his praise of russian president vladimir putin and his disdain for president barack obama saying that the russian enjoyed an 82 percent approval rating the man has very strong control over a country trump said it is a very different system and i don t happen to like the system but certainly in that system hes been a leader far more than our president has been a leader speaking to reporters in laos obama said thursday that trump confirms his belief that trump isn t qualified to be president every time he speaks and added the most important thing for the public and the press is to just listen to what he says and follow up and ask questions to what appear to be either contradictory or uninformed or outright wacky ideas trump and mister clinton spoke back to back wednesday night each fielding 30 minutes of questions while the candidates never appeared on stage together the session served as a preview of sorts for their highly anticipated presidential debates by virtue of a coin flip clinton took the stage first and quickly found herself responding at length to questions about her years in government she reiterated that she had made mistakes in relying on a personal email account and private server as secretary of state and in voting for the 2003 invasion of iraq as a senator but she defended her support for us military intervention to help oust a dictator in libya despite the chaotic aftermath i m asking to be judged on the totality of my record said clinton who grew visibly irritated at times with the repeated focus on her past actions clinton who has cast trump as dangerously ill prepared to be commander in chief tried to center the discussion on her foreign policy proposals she vowed to defeat the islamic state group without committing american ground troops to iraq or syria and she pledged to hold weekly oval office meetings with representatives from the pentagon and department of veterans affairs to stay abreast of health care for veterans trump did little to counter the criticism that he lacks detailed policy proposals particularly regarding the islamic state group he both insisted he has a private blueprint for defeating the extremist group and that he would demand a plan from military leaders within 30 days of taking office but he was also harshly critical of the military saying americas generals have been reduced to rubble under obama asked to square his request for military options with that criticism trump said simply they ll probably be different generals trump stood by a previous comment that appeared to blame military sexual assaults on men and women serving together but added he would not seek to remove women from the military and for the first time he opened the door to granting legal status to people living in the us illegally who join the military i think that when you serve in the armed forces thats a very special situation trump said and i could not see myself working that out the republican also repeated an incorrect claim that he was opposed to the war with iraq before the invasion that assertion is contradicted by an interview trump did with howard stern in september 2002 in which he was asked whether he supported the invasion he replied yeah i guess so with just two months until election day national security has emerged as a centerpiece issue in the white house race both candidates believe they have the upper hand with clinton contrasting her experience with trumps unpredictability and the republican arguing that americans worried about their safety will be left with more of the same if they elect obamas former secretary of state this event and the upcoming presidential debates could not be particularly important in the closing days of this election as the christian science monitor reports this year an unusually large percentage of the electorate says it hasn t made up its mind or will vote for a third party candidate thats a big chunk of folks who might swing in one way or another when the pressure of choosing on election day actually nears for instance wall street journal/nbc polling shows 13 percent of voters undecided in 2016 the corresponding figure from this time in 2012 was 8 percent “we are seeing a historically high number of potential voters who aren t committing to either major party candidate at this point writes middlebury college political science professor matthew dickinson on his“presidential power blog while republican party candidates are often seen by voters as having an advantage on military and national security issues trump is far from a traditional republican he has no military experience and has repeatedly criticized the skill of the armed forces a flood of republican national security experts have instead chosen to back clinton helping bolster her case that trump is broadly unacceptable earlier wednesday former defense secretary william cohen joined the list of republican party officials supporting clinton ahead of the forum trump rolled out a new plan to boost military spending by tens of billions of dollars including major increases in the number of active troops fighter planes ships and submarines his address earlier in the day included plans to eliminate deep spending cuts known as the sequester that were enacted when congress failed to reach a budget compromise in 2011 republicans and democrats voted for the automatic across the board cuts that affected both military and domestic programs though the white house has long pressed congress to lift the spending limits trump expressed support for the sequester in interviews in 2013 even describing them as too small but seemed to suggest at the time that military spending should be exempt associated press writers jill colvin and erica werner in washington

1069,we are not electing a drinking buddy we are electing a president likeability is a smoke screen and yes it is sexist besides with her latest primary wins hillary clinton is all but guaranteed the democratic nomination but exit polls in some of the states where she has been victorious indicate that she is far from guaranteed the presidency more pointedly polls make it clear that if hillary wants to win she may have to find the courage to admit something most women are afraid to while a majority of recent democratic voters deemed clinton trustworthy democrats who ranked honesty as the most important quality in their decision chose bernie sanders additionally more than half of americans hold an unfavorable opinion of her clintons favorability numbers are still better than donald trumps but the question is not really whether a majority of american voters will choose donald trump they won t the question is whether enough voters opposing his candidacy will turn out on election day and as volunteers beforehand for hillary clinton to win the even larger question however is why so many voters have such strong negative reactions to hillary clinton in the first place after all many of the same voters who disdain her for being “dishonest will cheer for her husband you know the one who actually did lie to all of us remember “i did not have sexual relations with that woman? of course for many the distinction between how the two clintons are viewed is clear hes a man and shes a woman we ve all heard it said before “a woman is called difficult for behavior that gets a man hailed as assertive bill clinton is not seen as a liar but simply as a mischievously rakish leader who was economical with the truth hillary on the other hand is a lying harpy i m sure that sexism has played a role in how hillary clinton is perceived and critiqued by some because no woman in the public eye as much as she is or as long as she has been is immune to sexist critiques (i get them regularly) but the reality is that the real difference between bill and hillary clinton is a difference all of us have faced in life whether in junior high or the office bill is simply more likable in the same way george w bush was seen as more fun and friendly than his more intellectually accomplished and responsible brother jeb bill is preferred by most people with a pulse over his more responsible wife every election we hear about the importance of the so called “beer test as in “who do voters want to have a beer with? hillary clinton screams a lot of things but person you want to chill with in your free time is not one of them (which is why president obamas backhanded compliment of clinton as “likable enough landed like the diss that it was) but i believe the real problem for hillary clinton is not that her husband is more likable than she is but that it is obvious that she cares so much like a lot of women do i remember a conversation i had with a female friend just before an important meeting i was supposed to have with a prominent media person i was nervous because for a variety of reasons i suspected the person i was meeting with might not be a personal fan of mine when i finished laying out my concerns my friend who is significantly more successful said “this is the difference between men and women why do you care if he likes you or not? you got the meeting because his bosss boss thinks you re qualified and if they tell him to work with you he will this may sound like a fairly unimportant anecdote in the context of a presidential campaign but for some of the women i ve shared it with over the years it is revelatory the reason because women are taught early on to spend much of our time energy and social capital pleasing others boys are taught to be smart girls are taught to be smart but not at the expense of being popular and certainly not at the expense of being pretty because after all accomplishments ultimately mean very little in the big scheme of things if when it is all said and done you re a woman who is perceived as unattractive unlovable and unlikable hillary clinton the candidate voters don t trust was deemed the most trustworthy presidential candidate on terror following the recent brussels attack but of course thats not quite the same as being loved or liked but it does seem to indicate that plenty of americans know that the job of president is far too serious to be decided the same way we decide who we want to sit with in the cafeteria in high school instead of trying desperately to generate laughs on “saturday night live or “broad city or some other outlets her team of advisors have convinced her are essential to making her likable enough to win she should finally do something most of us would never have the courage to do but wish that we did which is to say this “i know i m not what you d call likable and that you may not like me or think of me as a fun beer date but i m really qualified and for a job this serious i think thats what should matter after all do you care whether your heart surgeon is likable?.,REAL

820,kahlida lloyd can explain her reasons for voting for hillary clinton even if she is not especially excited about them but she has a hard time making the case to obstinate friends why they should support the democratic presidential nominee lloyd 31 a lawyer sought advice from other black millennials during a recent lunchtime gathering in downtown washington what should she say to encourage young black voters who rallied in 2008 and 2012 to help barack obama make history as the first african american president to show a little of that enthusiasm for clinton? “i just don t want the first woman president to be elected because the other person sucks but thats where i think we are lloyd said in an interview after the event last week hosted by #wevote a new effort aimed at mobilizing young black voters “people either say donald trump is not where it is at so i m going to vote for hillary or you have people say donald trump is not where it is at; i m not going to vote at all and thats not cool younger african americans like many millennials are not excited about this years presidential election the clinton campaign which has sought to reassemble the obama coalition has struggled to connect with a key piece of it voters under 30 turnout among african americans under age 30 spiked from 49 percent in 2004 to 57 percent in 2008 but it dipped to 53 percent in 2012 according to census bureau data while 43 percent of obama supporters under age 40 were “very enthusiastic about him in 2012 just 24 percent of clinton supporters under age 40 feel the same way about her now according to september averages of washington post abc news polls from four years ago and this year black activists and organizers frustrated with the clinton campaigns inability to engage young voters have taken it upon themselves to challenge their peers to consider the consequences if republicans take the white house and keep control of both houses of congress they also have encouraged young voters to focus on state and local elections because those officials make decisions about how police departments and schools are run issues that more directly affect their lives [for black and engaged millennial activists politics is local] voting rights were an important victory of the civil rights era and because trumps campaign has laid bare racist attitudes the seeming indifference of black millennials to the election has sparked broad discussion within the african american community but young people who say that the political system has failed them argue that they don t owe it to anyone not even the often cited warriors of the civil rights movement to participate in the presidential election many are critical of some black political leaders for framing the election as a choice between an archenemy and an old friend rather than talking about the issues such as what they view as broken economic and criminal justice systems “we know what the issues are what we can t seem to get is candidates to talk about them in a nuanced way said lauren brown 34 a public relations professional who said she has not been moved by clintons talking points on addressing police violence against black people or economic equity for women of color “this election cycle is more about who you hate more than who you like brown decided to vote for clinton after taking part in a discussion during an event hosted last month in philadelphia by a civic project called black and engaged about the stakes in the campaign trumps debate performances also helped sway her carmen berkley director of civil human and womens rights for the afl cio said many black millennials have to stop “waiting to have that same level of excitement they felt for obamas campaign “if i had my choice of who would be the president it probably would be michelle obama but shes not running for president hillary clinton is but the first lady and the president could not be effective surrogates to persuade young black people to put aside their doubts about voting for clinton although michelle obamas well regarded speech taking on trumps vulgar comments about women was made before a largely white audience in new hampshire it was widely shared and discussed on social media and black women in particular praised the first lady for speaking out about sexual harassment [black women are most worried about the outcome of the 2016 election poll finds] denise horn a spokeswoman for the campaign said the obamas are among several surrogates including senator bernie sanders (vt) and elizabeth warren (mass) who are popular among millennial voters and will continue to make the case for clinton berkley 31 said some black millennials are being overly critical of clinton for instance by continuing to criticize her for supporting her husbands 1994 crime bill and using the term “super predator to describe some young offenders they don t give her credit for having apologized or for pledging to work to achieve criminal justice reform “here you have a candidate who says i messed up and i m willing to change   berkley said “i think that is powerful we have as activists organizers and everyday people the power to bring pressure on political leaders to get what we want symone d sanders 26 a top aide to sen bernie sanders during his democratic primary campaign co founded #wevote along with three other millennial activists to urge their peers to register and vote lloyd was among about 145 people who attended the washington event similar gatherings are planned around the country other efforts to engage millennial activists include blackpac which got funding from the pro clinton super pac priorities usa to do outreach in florida and the color of change pac which got money from the progressive for our future super pac to court voters in battleground states via text message “i think it is extremely important that the message we take from this room when we are going out into our individual networks is that this is not the election to sit on the sidelines sanders said during last weeks discussion “there are so many things as president obama has said that are on

396,exclusive the state departments former top watchdog in an interview with fox news rejected hillary clintons repeated claims that her personal email use was in line with her predecessors while saying he would have immediately opened an investigation if he caught wind of a secretary of state using such an account howard krongard a george w bush administration appointee who served as the state department inspector general from april 2005 to january 2008 cited his own experience in challenging clintons insistence that her practices were nothing out of the ordinary “certainly to my knowledge at least secretary [condoleezza] rice did not have a personal server i certainly never either senator an email to one or received an email from one said krongard who served during rices tenure further he said “i would have been stunned had i been asked to senator an email to her at a personal server private address i would have declined to do so on security grounds and if she had senator one to me i probably would have started an investigation krongard noted that during clintons four year term from january 2009 to january 2013 there was no senate confirmed inspector general in place suggesting the clintons show a pattern of avoiding oversight krongard indicated that hillary clinton benefited from the fact there was no ig during her term i would ve been the most unpopular person in that building [had i been there] krongard said emphasizing that the inspector general has broad powers and the ability to rein in even the most senior political appointees they are the people who enforce the rules and there was no one enforcing the rules during that time krongard spoke with fox news before the current state department inspector generals office led by steve a linick issued an extensive report on email practices of previous secretaries of state the day that report was issued clinton said in an interview that her use of personal email was consistent with predecessors colin powell and rice just like previous secretaries of state i used a personal email many people did it was not at all unprecedented she said but as krongard indicated the may 25 ig report clearly stated that rice did not use personal email for government business it said powell used personal email on a limited basis to connect with people outside the department and he worked with the state department to secure the system the report found clinton did neither the report concluded clintons use of a private server and account was not approved and broke agency rules the report said by the time she became secretary the rules had repeatedly been updated and were “considerably more detailed and more sophisticated krongard resigned from the ig position in december 2007 after accusations he blocked iraq related investigations charges he denied regarding the 2 100 emails on clintons server found to have contained classified information and another 22 “top secret messages containing intelligence deemed too damaging to national security to make public krongard questioned how that material got there he said it would take a deliberate act for the intelligence to jump the gap between the classified computer networks and clintons personal server it could not be done by taking a screen shot with … a camera of a classified email take a screen shot and senator it to an unclassified network it could not be copied but there are restrictions in the state department and elsewhere as to what copiers can work from a classified network and it can only be a secure copier so that may not have been easy krongard said asked if it could not happen by accident krongard simply said no he also challenged clinton and state department claims that the emails in question were “retroactively classified i don t understand it because it was either classified by the creator or it was classified by reason of where it came from or what network it was on krongard said clinton consistently has claimed nothing she senator or received was marked classified at the time while technically correct this distinction also appears misleading a january 2009 non disclosure agreement signed by clinton confirms her understanding that classified information is marked or unmarked rather it is the content and source that determine classification former intelligence officials say the emails were improperly handled by clinton and her team and once reviewed by the authority that originated the information the emails were given proper classification markings while there is no public confirmation the clinton server was breached former senior military and intelligence officials including secretary of defense robert gates and former defense intelligence agency chief mike flynn have said they believe foreign intelligence services targeted clintons email system in a recent interview with fox news the romanian hacker who goes by the name guccifer said he accessed the clinton server with ease in march 2013 anonymous government officials were quick to dismiss the hackers claims while admitting he was very skilled and breached the accounts of 100 americans including powell

914,justice antonin scalias death is a test for the american political system a test it is unlikely to pass the test is simple can divided government actually govern given todays more polarized parties? in the past it could not in 1988 a presidential election year a democratic senate unanimously approved president ronald reagans nomination of anthony kennedy to the supreme court the senate wasn t passive; it had previously rejected reagans initial nominee robert bork and reagans second choice douglas ginsburg dropped out of the running however it ultimately did its job even amidst an election and divided party control of the government but moments after reports first filtered out of scalias death and with no knowledge of whom president obama planned to name as scalias replacement senior republicans said they wouldn t even consider an appointment from obama despite the fact that he has almost a year left in his presidency ted cruz was first to voice this opinion but it was senate majority leader mitch mcconnells statement that carried the most consequence the american people should have a voice in the selection of their next supreme court justice he said therefore this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president the american people of course already did have a voice in the selection of scalias replacement they reelected barack obama to office in 2012 but they also made mitch mcconnell majority leader in 2014 these elections carried out in different years midst different electorates and using different electoral systems are equally valid obama and mcconnells claims of democratic legitimacy are simultaneously correct the american people speak with a divided voice and our system carries no mechanism for resolving their confusion this is why political systems like ours rarely survive indeed as the late sociologist juan linz wrote aside from the united states only chile has managed a century and a half of relatively undisturbed constitutional continuity under presidential government but chilean democracy broke down in the 1970s the reason for the american political systems strength linz argued was that our parties were unusual in that they lacked clear ideological distinction both the democratic and republican parties contained both conservatives and liberals for a system that required compromise to function that made compromise unusually easy to find but in recent decades our political parties have become sharply distinct with liberals clustered in the democratic party and conservatives clustered in the republican party the result is a level of party polarization american politics simply hasn t seen before the great unanswered question of american politics in this era is whether our divided political system can function in times of stress already there have been worrying signs disagreement between a democratic president and a republican house nearly forced the united states to default on its debt in 2011 and it shut down the government in 2013 now we see another form of stress how does a divided political system where the disagreements are sharper than ever fill a supreme court nomination? as of now the answer republicans are giving is simple it doesn t their hope is that they can keep obama from nominating a justice and then they will win the presidency next year and simply make the nomination themselves no compromise necessary but it is a strange precedent to say that amidst divided government a presidents final year in office which means two of his eight years because the precedent could not apply to both his fourth and eighth years is a year in which hard decisions can t be made and crucial vacancies can t be filled and what if hillary clinton wins the presidency in 2016 but republicans keep the senate? what do republicans do then? this isn t to predict constitutional collapse over a supreme court vacancy (though today is a good day to read matt yglesiass essay on these underlying forces and how they could not eventually lead to a serious crisis) but if american politics cannot fill a supreme court vacancy amidst divided government in any of the 25 percent of years that are presidential election years then that is proof that our system is deteriorating in its capacity to govern amidst divided party control that the space for effective governance is narrowing because of party polarization divided government is a common occurrence in american politics it didn t used to signal disaster for the systems ability to solve problems if it does so now then the country will over time pay a serious price for a political system that no longer fits its political parties.,REAL

it doesn t make us safer it is an affront to our common humanity thats why last summer i directed attorney general loretta e lynch and the justice department to review the overuse of solitary confinement across us prisons they found that there are circumstances when solitary is a necessary tool such as when certain prisoners must be isolated for their own protection or in order to protect staff and other inmates in those cases the practice should be limited applied with constraints and used only as a measure of last resort they have identified common sense principles that should guide the use of solitary confinement in our criminal justice system the justice department has completed its review and i am adopting its recommendations to reform the federal prison system these include banning solitary confinement for juveniles and as a response to low level infractions expanding treatment for the mentally ill and increasing the amount of time inmates in solitary can spend outside of their cells these steps will affect some 10 000 federal prisoners held in solitary confinement and hopefully serve as a model for state and local corrections systems and i will direct all relevant federal agencies to review these principles and report back to me with a plan to address their use of solitary confinement [more coverage obama bans solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons] states that have led the way are already seeing positive results colorado cut the number of people in solitary confinement and assaults against staff are the lowest they ve been since 2006 new mexico implemented reforms and has seen a drop in solitary confinement with more prisoners engaging in promising rehabilitation programs and since 2012 federal prisons have cut the use of solitary confinement by 25 percent and significantly reduced assaults on staff reforming solitary confinement is just one part of a broader bipartisan push for criminal justice reform every year we spend 80 dollars billion to keep 22 million people incarcerated many criminals belong behind bars but too many others especially nonviolent drug offenders are serving unnecessarily long sentences thats why members of congress in both parties are pushing for change from reforming sentencing laws to expanding reentry programs to give those who have paid their debt to society the tools they need to become productive members of their communities and i hope they will senator me legislation as soon as possible that makes our criminal justice system smarter fairer less expensive and more effective in america we believe in redemption we believe in the words of pope francis that “every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes we believe that when people make mistakes they deserve the opportunity to remake their lives and if we can give them the hope of a better future and a way to get back on their feet then we will leave our children with a country that is safer stronger and worthy of our highest ideals.,REAL

2928,united nations (reuters) france made a new plea on monday for the united states to preserve the 2015 iran nuclear deal and suggested its provisions expiring after a decade could not be strengthened as us president donald trump again criticized the agreement as “deeply flawed the pact between tehran and six world powers which calls for iran to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions is under threat as trump must decide by oct 15 whether to certify iran is keeping its end of the bargain if trump who as recently as thursday accused iran of violating “the spirit of the deal chooses not to certify the pact could not unravel possibly triggering a regional arms race the republican president who has called the agreement struck under his democratic predecessor barack obama “the worst deal ever negotiated made no secret of his views during a meeting with french president emmanuel macron “the president believes that the jcpoa is deeply flawed and he did share his views with president macron about how he believes the deal is flawed brian hook director of policy planning at the us state department told reporters the pact is formally called the joint comprehensive plan of action “the president was very candid with him about what he thinks are the shortcomings he told him that it is under review and that they are taking a hard look at the oct 15th decision and more broadly how to fix the iran deal hook said hook said the two also discussed an integrated strategy against iran that would take into account what he described as irans support for terrorism its ballistic missile program its destabilization in the middle east and other aggressions asked if he planned to stick with the pact trump earlier told reporters as he began a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday “you ll be seeing very soonisraeli officials have said changes israel wants in the jcpoa include lengthening the 10 year freeze on irans nuclear development program or even making that suspension permanent and destroying centrifuges rather than just halting their operation the deal was negotiated with iran by the united states russia china britain germany and france the six will meet with iran at the ministerial level on wednesday the prospect of washington reneging on the agreement has worried some of the us allies that helped negotiate it especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis north koreas nuclear and ballistic missile development “it is essential to maintain it to avoid proliferation in this period when we see the risks with north korea we must maintain this line french foreign minister jean yves le drian told reporters “france will try to convince president trump of the pertinence of this choice (keeping the accord) even if work can be done to complement the accord after 2025 he said a senior french official said trump had not given macron an indication on whether he had made up his mind during their monday bilateral however the official said macron had put on the table the prospect of new nuclear negotiations after 2025 during his bilateral with iranian president hasan rouhani and warned him that tehran should stop provoking the united states with its regional activities “we feel the post 2025 subject is a red line but our president put it on the table because it is a concern and a legitimate request that we must make the official said “2025 will arrive quickly and we have to be ready before jan 1 2025 so he asked that we think together how to work on this question if trump does not certify that iran is complying with the agreement the us congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal iran supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei warned on sunday that tehran would react strongly to any “wrong move by washington on the nuclear deal paris took one of the hardest lines against tehran in the negotiations but has been quick to restore trade ties and macron has said repeatedly there is no alternative to the deal french officials say iran is respecting the jcpoa and that were the international atomic energy agency (iaea) to say otherwise a mechanism exists to reimpose sanctions the iaea is the body ensuring the accord is carried out but the united states and iran quarreled over how tehrans nuclear activities should be policed at an iaea meeting on monday after a us call last month for wider inspections us secretary of state rex tillerson argued on friday that washington must consider the full threat it says iran poses to the middle east when crafting its new policy toward tehran a senior french diplomat underlined that the nuclear deal was achieved in large part because it was not linked to all the other grievances the united states may have had with iran with europeans not on the same page as the trump administration iranian officials say they have an opportunity to divide the p5+1 group that negotiated the deal with iran a senior iranian diplomat and a former nuclear negotiator said he believed the europeans had no intention of following trumps overtly aggressive iran policy “they are wise look at the region crisis everywhere from iraq to lebanon iran is a reliable regional partner for europe not only a trade partner but a political one as well the diplomat said “european powers have been committed to the deal the iaea has repeatedly confirmed irans commitment to the deal trumps insistence on his hostile policy towards iran will further deepen the gap among the p5+1 countries

monday as a picture began to emerge of the angry violent man who carried out americas deadliest mass shooting us authorities said they had found no direct links between islamic state and mateen the us born son of afghan immigrants who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in orlando on sunday mateen 29 was shot dead by police who stormed the pulse club with armored cars after a three hour siege in 911 calls during his rampage the killer expressed allegiance to islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi but federal bureau of investigation director james comey said mateen had made comments favorable to multiple armed islamist movements and people which “adds a little bit to the confusion about his motives president barack obama said mateen was likely a homegrown extremist “so far we see no indication that this was a plot directed from outside the united states and we see no indication that he was part of any kind of network comey told reporters in washington “we are highly confident this killer was radicalized at least in some part through the internet islamic state which controls territory in iraq and syria reiterated on monday a claim of responsibility although it offered no signs to indicate coordination with the gunman in calls to authorities on sunday mateen also mentioned support for the boston marathon bombers and a florida man who became a nusra front suicide bomber in syria comey said nusra is an al qaeda offshoot which is at odds with islamic state in syrias civil war co workers reported mateen to the fbi in 2013 after he had made “inflammatory and contradictory statements including a claim that he had family connections to al qaeda and membership of shi ite militant group hezbollah a bitter rival the fbis miami office investigated mateen for 10 months and interviewed him twice but found no evidence of a crime or connection with a militant group comey said the fbi was also “working to understand what role anti gay bigotry may have played in the attack the massacre reverberated on the presidential campaign trail where republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton the two likely opponents in the nov 8 election clashed over how to confront violent islamist extremists trump proposed suspending immigration to the united states from countries with a history of terrorism against america europe or us allies while clinton warned

2286,21st century wire says investigative reporter robert parry broke many of the iran contra stories for the associated press and newsweek in the 1980s and has been a featured guest on patrick henningsen live at 1100kfnx in this report robert asks due to mainstream media experts who versus fallen to careerism whom can we trust to deliver us the information to describe the world and its conflicts (image former secretary of state colin powell addressing the united nations on feb 5 2003)robert parry consortium newsthe looming threat of world war iii a potential extermination event for the human species is made more likely because the worlds public can t count on supposedly objective experts to ascertain and evaluate facts instead careerism is the order of the day among journalists intelligence analysts and international monitors meaning that almost no one who might normally be relied on to tell the truth can be trustedthe dangerous reality is that this careerism which often is expressed by a smug certainty about whatever the prevailing groupthink is pervades not just the political world where lies seem to be the common currency but also the worlds of journalism intelligence and international oversight including united nations agencies that are often granted greater credibility because they are perceived as less beholden to specific governments but in reality have become deeply corrupted tooin other words many professionals who are counted on for digging out the facts and speaking truth to power have sold themselves to those same powerful interests in order to keep high paying jobs and to not get tossed out onto the street many of these self aggrandizing professionals caught up in the many accouterments of success don t even seem to recognize how far they versus drifted from principled professionalisma good example was saturday nights spectacle of national journalists preening in their tuxedos and gowns at the white house correspondents dinner sporting first amendment pins as if they were some brave victims of persecution they seemed oblivious to how removed they are from middle america and how unlikely any of them would risk their careers by challenging one of the establishments favored groupthinks instead these national journalists take easy shots at president trumps buffoonish behavior and his serial falsehoods and count themselves as endangered heroes for the effortfoils for trumpironically though these pompous journalists gave trump what was arguably his best moment in his first 100 days by serving as foils for the president as he traveled to harrisburg pennsylvania on saturday and basked in the adulation of blue collar americans who view the mainstream media as just one more appendage of a corrupt ruling elitebreaking with tradition by snubbing the annual press gala trump delighted the harrisburg crowd by saying a large group of hollywood celebrities and washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom and adding i could not not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from [the] washington swamp with much much better people the crowd booed references to the elites and cheered trumps choice to be with the common folktrumps rejection of the dinner and his frequent criticism of the mainstream media brought a defensive response from jeff mason president of the white house correspondents association who complained we are not fake news we are not failing news organizations and we are not the enemy of the american people that brought the black tie and gown gathering to its feet in a standing ovationperhaps the assembled media elite had forgotten that it was the mainstream us media particularly the washington post and the new york times that popularized the phrase fake news and directed it blunderbuss style not only at the few web sites that intentionally invent stories to increase their clicks but at independent minded journalism outlets that have dared question the elites groupthinks on issues of war peace and globalizationthe black listprofessional journalistic skepticism toward official claims by the us government what you should expect from reporters became conflated with fake news the post even gave front page attention to an anonymous group called propornot that published a black list of 200 internet sites including consortiumnewscom and other independent minded journalism sites to be shunnedbut the mainstream media stars didn t like it when trump began throwing the fake news slur back at them thus the first amendment lapel pins and the standing ovation for jeff masons repudiation of the fake news labelyet as the glitzy white house correspondents dinner demonstrated mainstream journalists get the goodies of prestige and money while the real truth tellers are almost always outspent outgunned and cast out of the mainstream indeed this dwindling band of honest people who are both knowledgeable and in position to expose unpleasant truths is often under mainstream attack sometimes for unrelated personal failings and other times just for rubbing the powers that be the wrong wayperhaps the clearest case study of this up is down rewards and punishments reality was the iraq wars wmd rationale nearly across the board the american political/media system from us intelligence analysts to the deliberative body of the us senate to the major us news organizations failed to ascertain the truth and indeed actively helped disseminate the falsehoods about iraq hiding wmds and even suggested nuclear weapons development (arguably the most trusted us government official at the time secretary of state colin powell played a key role in selling the false allegations as truth )not only did the supposed american gold standard for assessing information the us political media and intelligence structure fail miserably in the face of fraudulent claims often from self interested iraqi opposition figures and their neoconservative american backers but there was minimal accountability afterwards for the professionals who failed to protect the public from lies and deceptionsprofiting from failureindeed many of the main culprits remain respected members of the journalistic establishment for instance the new york times pentagon correspondent michael r gordon who was the lead writer on the infamous aluminum tubes for nuclear centrifuges story which got the ball rolling for the bush administrations rollout of its invade iraq advertising campaign in september 2002 still covers national security for the times and still serves as a conveyor belt for us government propagandathe washington posts editorial page editor fred hiatt who repeatedly informed the posts readers that iraqs secret possession of wmd was a flat fact is still the posts editorial page editor one of the most influential positions in american journalismhiatts editorial page led a years long assault on the character of former us ambassador joseph wilson for the offense of debunking one of president george w bushs claims about iraq seeking yellowcake uranium from niger wilson had alerted the cia to the bogus claim before the invasion of iraq and went public with the news afterwards but the post treated wilson as the real culprit dismissing him as a blowhard and trivializing the bush administrations destruction of his wifes cia career by outing her (valerie plame) in order to discredit wilsons niger investigationat the end of the posts savaging of wilsons reputation and in the wake of the newspapers accessory role in destroying plames career wilson and plame decamped from washington to new mexico meanwhile hiatt never suffered a whit and remains a respected washington media figure to this daycareerist lessonthe lesson that any careerist would draw from the iraq case is that there is almost no downside risk in running with the pack on a national security issue even if you re horrifically wrong even if you contribute to the deaths of some 4 500 us soldiers and hundreds of thousands of iraqis your paycheck is almost surely safethe same holds true if you work for an international agency that is responsible for monitoring issues like chemical weapons again the iraq example offers a good case study in april 2002 as president bush was clearing away the few obstacles to his iraq invasion plans jose mauricio bustani the head of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons [opcw] sought to persuade iraq to join the chemical weapons convention so inspectors could not verify iraqs claims that it had destroyed its stockpilesthe bush administration called that idea an ill considered initiative after all it could not have stripped away the preferred propaganda rationale for the invasion if the opcw verified that iraq had destroyed its chemical weapons so bushs undersecretary of state for arms control john bolton a neocon advocate for the invasion of iraq pushed to have bustani deposed the bush administration threatened to withhold dues to the opcw if bustani a brazilian diplomat remainedit now appears obvious that bush and bolton viewed bustanis real offense as interfering with their invasion scheme but bustani was ultimately taken down over accusations of mismanagement although he was only a year into a new five year term after having been reelected unanimously the opcw member states chose to sacrifice bustani to save the organization from the loss of us funds but in so doing they compromised its integrity making it just another agency that would bend to big power pressure by dismissing me bustani said an international precedent will have been established whereby any duly elected head of any international organization would at any point during his or her tenure remain vulnerable to the whims of one or a few major contributors he added that if the united states succeeded in removing him genuine multilateralism would succumb to unilateralism in a multilateral

812,(cnn) hillary clinton and donald trump are historically unpopular but large numbers of americans who can t stand them will likely vote for one of them anyway they ll do this because among other reasons they ll feel forced into choosing the lesser of two evils and they shouldn t feel (or more importantly vote) this way us presidential elections were never supposed to devolve into contests between just two people even though thats what happens in a winner take all system such as ours the constitution does not mention political parties at all and the framers were worried that the rise of powerful factions would undermine liberty as john adams wrote in a letter in 1780 there is nothing which i dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties each arranged under its leader and concerting measures in opposition to each other this in my humble apprehension is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our constitution and even in 2016 voters still have choices beyond clinton or trump a viable third party has put forth a compelling alternative in the form of libertarian gary johnson for the second presidential election in a row the libertarian party has chosen johnson a softspoken entrepreneur and former governor of new mexico as its candidate his running mate is the impressive former governor of massachusetts william weld and just in the last few days david french a constitutional lawyer national review writer and iraq war veteran has emerged as a potential independent candidate both served as moderate republicans who generally opposed runaway government spending while advocating social tolerance weld cut spending and privatized state services earning high marks from the cato institute a libertarian think tank johnson pushed for school choice reforms and low taxes both supported drug decriminalization and same sex marriage as such both embody the libertarian philosophy that government should leave people alone an approach that is broadly popular with the american public many voters are quick to dismiss third party candidates but johnson and weld are different between them they have 16 years of successful executive experience as governors working effectively with legislators opposition and the business community alike contrast this with the presumptive republican and democratic nominees donald trump is a thin skinned reality tv star with an authoritarian streak and hillary clinton is a former secretary of state whose signature contribution to foreign policy the 2011 military intervention in libya was an unmitigated disaster it is no wonder americans are reacting unfavorably to the idea of deciding whether donald trumps complete lack of experience decorum and honesty are more disqualifying than hillary clintons sleaziness and corruption and yet they will continue to struggle because americans are being bombarded by talking heads and political operatives depicting this race as a clash between just two choices democrat or republican left or right a or b people who even entertain other options are castigated for throwing away their votes the republican party in particular is fond of telling people that a vote for the libertarian party is a vote for clinton (and it tried a similar tactic in 2012 with president obama) in reality nothing could not be further from the truth a vote for johnson isn t a vote for anyone other than johnson indeed the founders never intended to set up a system that continuously produced just two choices and modern americans recognize that it is almost always better to have more choices than fewer consumers want the option to shop around for everything from cable companies to health care providers to ice cream flavors additional choices provide people with more autonomy and agency to make the decision that fits them rather than feel morally obligated to engage in a less bad calculus this is coincidentally the creed of the libertarian party that choice allows people to be happier and more fulfilled and government interference reduces choice by limiting competition this belief comes from a place of philosophical consistency among fiscal foreign and social policy a rarity among politicians libertarians are for instance as uncomfortable with the government telling them who they can marry as they are with the government telling them who they can pay to uber them around town if voters aren t in love with this philosophy or for whatever reason don t think johnson is their man they are free to vote for someone else including the presumptive major party candidates but voters who overlook johnson as a viable option just because they ve bought into lesser of two evils urgency need a reality check no one persons vote has ever or will ever determine the outcome of a us presidential election while it is true that every vote counts for the individual voter voting is a largely symbolic act the most important thing any voter can do is vote for the person who best embodies his or her ideals whether or not that candidate has a good chance at winning the white house johnson has no realistic chance but high turnout for the libertarians could not qualify them for debates campaign funding and help grow the party in numerous other ways so if you re reading this and are one of the many agonizing over voting for trump or growing sick to death of the clintons know you have the option to vote for the person you actually want to be president that could not be gary johnson and william weld but it need not be and the same holds true for independent candidates like david french celebrate choice on election day and you won t walk out of the ballot box feeling profoundly dissatisfied.,REAL

975,(cnn) donald trump descended the famous escalator in trump tower one year ago thursday to launch a presidential campaign that seemed so outrageous provocative and unconventional that it was dismissed as reality television a year later trump is the presumptive republican nominee his showman style with its brass knuckled tactics defiance of decorum and itchy twitter finger approach has created a new brand of politics that is entirely his own now he is testing the limits of his persona during the general election campaign republican leaders are distancing themselves from their nominee and his controversial remarks and he is threatening to go it alone without their help never have the lines between news and entertainment been blurred as much as they have in this presidential cycle trump has driven breathless minute by minute press coverage injected with all the drama of a telenovela even amid the carnage and mourning in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in us history this week was no exception trumps wild ride to take over the republican party trumps wild ride to take over the republican party 03 25 trumps wild ride to take over the republican party trump used teleprompters and a statesman like setting to address the nation but the speech was every bit as outrageous must see tv as hillary clintons was predictable some republicans watched with amazement as trump used the mass tragedy to cast suspicion on president barack obama renew his call for a muslim travel ban and advance the eyebrow raising proposal that the united states should seal its borders to all immigrants from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the us and its allies with a mind bending twist that perhaps only trump could not pull off a candidate who opposes gay marriage and has spent the past year appealing to social conservatives justified his proposed ban by stating it was necessary to protect the lgbt community which was targeted in sundays shooting in orlando we are taking in thousands of people into our country we have no idea where they come from we have no idea who the hell they are trump said on the campaign trail on wednesday we aren t vigilant and we aren t smart and we have to go and we have to maybe check respectfully the mosques trumps rhetoric this week which was couched in a rejection of political correctness elicited outrage from obama where does this stop? he asked house speaker paul ryan who is backing trump was forced to again denounce trumps call for a ban on travel by muslims the show goes on but the trump show went on he dismissed the rejection of his remarks by the president as though the two were engaged in a personal quarrel the real estate mogul reacted to the obvious discomfort among republicans with a vague threat of parting ways with the party reprimanding republican leaders as needing to get tougher or be quiet he said we have to have our republicans either stick together or let me just do it by myself i m going to do very well though trumps unfavorability ratings have risen to their highest level 70% in a new washington post/abc poll trump suggested wednesday that his standing would improve after the horrendous horrendous attack i tell you people are tired they want to have strength they want to have intelligence he said during a speech in atlanta clinton and trump ever present figures on television and in popular culture for decades are the biggest stars to face off in a general election in generations their responses to the tragedy in orlando illustrate the vastly different ways they intend to harness that star power and will serve as the strongest test yet of whether merging celebrity and politics can win the presidency clinton with her reserved risk averse intellectual image is betting the american people will ultimately choose steady over unpredictable even though voters have signaled a vast appetite for change and a new kind of politics once again this week she called trump tempermentally unfit for the presidency it was one thing when he was a reality tv personality you know raising his arms and yelling you re fired clinton said in pittsburgh it is another thing altogether when hes the republican partys presumptive nominee for president at the same time trumps formula faces new scrutiny as he tries to appeal to a far more diverse general election audience in the wake of domestic terror attack from his hail fire of tweets assigning blame after the orlando shooting to his attention grabbing antics like revoking the credentials of the washington post monday he is testing the limits of whether that broader swath of the electorate will embrace his showmans persona at a time when the nation is gripped by fear and anxiety about terrorism as officials were still identifying bodies from orlandos pulse nightclub sunday trump first tweeted that he was praying for the victims he then rebuked past criticism of his campaign with breathtaking bravado appreciate the congrats for being right on radical islamic terrorism i don t want congrats i want toughness & vigilance we must be smart! he then successfully stirred up a daylong controversy over whether obama and clinton would use the words radical islamic terrorism and blamed weak and ineffective leadership for the ban his vague comments seeming to link obama to the orlando shooting in a fox interview monday sparked a new firestorm by monday evening when clintons campaign chairman was offered his critique of trumps speech as a rambling remarks that offered nothing that came close to resembling a real strategy for fighting terrorists trump had already moved on to his next line of attack against clinton via twitter noting that clinton called on the saudis the qataris and the kuwaitis to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations trump accused her of hypocrisy by noting that the clinton foundation has taken millions from the kingdom of saudi arabia crooked hillary says we must call on saudi arabia and other countries to stop funding hate i am calling on her to immediately return the 25 dollars million plus she got from them for the clinton foundation! trump wrote on twitter and facebook for all thats different about their clashing styles in some ways trump and clinton face some of the same challenges as they try to persuade voters this fall they are two of the most famous people in the world with near universal name recognition they also have the highest unfavorable ratings of any candidates who have ever run for president trump has scoffed at the notion that he would make some kind of general election pivot and begin behaving like the decorous republican party nominee of elections past clinton in turn has made it clear that she will try to run as a statesman brushing off trumps innuendo ignoring his provocations about her personal life and framing her general election campaign as a point by point takedown of trumps knowledge temperament and fitness to serve as commander in chief the former secretary of state is showing a greater willingness to take on trump more directly in pointed speeches and pithy tweets but she has yet to prove that she can be nimble and effective in the new furiously paced political arena that trump has created and controlled for the past ten months his use of twitter as a communication medium to bring conflict to his opponents and have that conflict covered by the media in the way that espn covers sports is transformational in politics said steve schmidt a republican strategist who ran john mccains campaign in 2008 with trumps skeletal campaign staff and paltry spending on advertising he has challenged the notion that a presidential campaign needs a massive infrastructure with hundreds of staff members and well heeled strategists (though that may come back to haunt him as clintons ground game rolls into gear) trump has also single handedly redefined the bounds of what a candidate can say or do the culture around politics and discussion on the comment threads and the blogs has been disgusting for a long time schmidt said but candidates conducted themselves with a level of decorum and a sense of guard rails of what could not be said hes shattered that beyond the vitriol and shocking statements ucla political science professor lynn vavreck argues that the other revolutionary aspect of his campaign is the fact that he is running his political operation the same way he would run his business with a set of tactics instead of a set of long term strategies in that sense trump has taken political marketing and branding to a new level it isn t just his refusal to back down when challenged over controversial statements or proposals like the muslim ban that he doubled down on monday but that he seems intent on following the mantra that he must repeat the same message over and over again louder and louder everything he does is the best the most amazing and now he would extend his golden touch to make america great again it is the idea of business marketing that if you can just convince the consumer that your product really is better you re winning said vavreck who co authored the gamble choice and chance in the 2012 presidential election she noted the irony of how much the political landscape has changed since 1952 when then presidential candidate adlai stevenson refused to appear in political ads because he said american people would be shocked by such contempt for their intelligence because the race for a white house wasn t ivory soap versus palmolive by contrast vavreck said trump has turned himself into a bar of soap hes brought this business marketing model to the presidential campaign in a way that nobodys done before it is far too early to predict whether any downballot candidates will try to replicate trumps style or if any of them can command the stage as he has but many are watching closely to see how clinton will adapt and whether trumps style will wear on voters over time particularly on those republicans who were cool to him during the primary process veteran democratic strategist bill carrick noted that trump has a challenging task ahead particularly as the spotlight winnows to just two candidates and voters draw closer to decision time there was a huge difference between him and the 17 other republicans who ran he commanded incredible attention because he was more interesting as a personality more interesting as an ideological outlier in the republican party more interesting as this bombastic bully said carrick in the general election it is a one on one contest hes got to get more than 30% of the vote; and hes got to give the group of voters who have not participated in the primary some confidence that hes capable of being president as he faced the new test of his candidacy for the white house this week in the wake of a national tragedy trump reflected on the past year i came down those escalators and who knew this was going to happen trump said it is been an amazing journey.,REAL

340,cleveland you could not be forgiven for wanting to pop a valium at the end of donald trumps acceptance speech last night the republican nominee painted a stark picture of a hobbesian america that is nasty brutish and short trump essentially used the most important speech of his campaign and perhaps political career to yell fire in a crowded theatre he warned that we are in “a moment of crisis and made the case that these desperate times call for desperate measures while the message seem tailored to the same disaffected and angry working class voters who fueled his primary victories he clearly wanted to convince a national audience that things are so bad right now that they should swallow whatever doubts they have to take a chance on him “beginning on january 20th of 2017 safety will be restored he declared trump is the crisis candidate if voters feel safe confident and hopeful in november his team knows he will lose to win he does not just need to convince americans that the country is on the wrong track they already believe this but that we are in the midst of an existential crisis “the attacks on our police and the terrorism in our cities threaten our very way of life he said repeatedly touting himself as “the law and order candidate he spoke of a violent crime wave murderous illegal immigrants “roaming free innocent children “sacrificed on the altar of open borders and an america “shocked to its core he described the current environment as “more dangerous … than frankly i have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen then he suggested that elites are covering up how bad things have gotten “i will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper he declared trump also spoke of “growing threats from outside the country “after fifteen years of wars in the middle east after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost the situation is worse than it has ever been before he said “this is the legacy of hillary clinton death destruction terrorism and weakness the newly minted nominee grasped for the mantle of change agent without offering many specifics “a change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes he said clocking in at 76 minutes it was the longest acceptance speech at any major party convention since 1972 drawing comparisons to fidel castro yet trump never tried to be uplifting or inspiring when hes not reading from a teleprompter he can be charming and magnetic he can also be somewhat self deprecating which supporters find ingratiating but he did not try to be in this setting “in a remarkable departure from past republican party conventions trump made no mention of god religion or his faith philip rucker and david fahrenthold note “ making america afraid again is how david maraniss sums up the week the posts editorial board calls trump “the candidate of the apocalypse “no doubt for many of his listeners his words expressed a deeply felt emotional reality there is real fear in the land; real pain but it will take real leadership not the wishful demagogic brand mr trump embodied thursday night to address this many of the claims don t hold up under scrutiny our in house fact checkers challenge the accuracy of 25 different assertions trump made last night “the dark portrait of america … is a compendium of doomsday stats that fall apart upon close scrutiny glenn kessler and michelle ye hee lee write “numbers are taken out of context data is manipulated and sometimes the facts are wrong when facts are inconveniently positive such as rising incomes and an unemployment rate under 5 percent trump simply declines to mention them he describes an exceedingly violent nation flooded with murders when in reality the violent crime rate has been cut in half since the crack cocaine epidemic hit its peak in 1991 (max ehrenfreund has more on why trumps crime stats were cherry picked and misleading; read an annotated version of the full transcript here) “if reality does not conform to what trump needs reality to be to support his case he will invent a new reality ej dionne writes an array of key republican thought leaders expressed angst and alarm about the tenor of trumps speech heres a sampling of the reaction a conservative blogger in the never trump camp the editor in chief of the conservative richochetcom a republican party pollster who specializes in outreach to young people the conservative columnist at the nyt the mainstream media was also taken aback by the gloom the financial timess us columnist a culture reporter for the new york times trump really does want to be the new nixon as promised earlier this week his speech heavily drew on and echoed richard nixons acceptance speech at the 1968 convention “i am your voice trump said saying that he will fight tirelessly for millions who have been “forgotten like nixon trump is clearly motivated by profound grievance and a yearning to be shown respect by elites who have never taken him seriously he bragged at both the beginning and the end of his speech about how many votes he received in the primaries and how he proved the pundits wrong oh we love defeating those people don t we? he asked the crowd “i am with you i will fight for you and i will win for you “i wonder what my dad would think of my tremendous success trump said late in the speech but he did not sketch out autobiographical details that could not have made him more relatable in nixons 1968 rnc speech for instance he spoke poignantly about being a poor boy in california listening to the train go by at night and dreaming of a better future we got nothing like that from trump perhaps because the billionaire does not have those kinds of stories to tell… a textbook cult of personality trump did however present himself as a white knight who is singularly capable of restoring order “nobody knows the system better than me which is why i alone can fix it he insisted “i have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police he said at another point “when i take the oath of office next year i will restore law and order to our country believe me believe me wonkblogs jim tankersley compares the text of trumps speech last night to reagans speech at the republican party convention in detroit in 1980 “most strikingly reagan warned voters to place their faith in free people not powerful leaders trust me government asks that we concentrate our hopes and dreams on one man; that we trust him to do whats best for us he said my view of government places trust not in one person or one party but in those values that transcend persons and parties the trust is where it belongs in the people in this vein post opinion blogger alexandra petri describes the final night of trumps convention as a “creepy fascist infomercial “donald trump is selling america a miracle juicer the juicer is donald trump it is orange and it will never let you down if you order now donald trump will senator you another one free more broadly trump clearly believes in his heart that government is the solution to our problems this is of course should be anathema to intellectually honest movement conservatives and is totally at odds with 36 years of orthodoxy the political editor at buzzfeed who previously wrote for the conservative free beacon trump rejected other core tents of modern conservatism as well “americanism not globalism will be our credo he said but trump now owns the republican party at least until november the audience cheered and applauded for a lot of lines that conservatives in the not distant past would have booed a democrat for saying he sounded protectionist and isolationist themes sure not everyone was applauding and perhaps some in the audience didn t understand what exactly he was referring to but the crowd was with him trumps alarmism makes it imperative for democrats to offer a counter narrative next week most democrats are still far too dismissive of trumps chances they discount him at their own peril just ask jeb wherever hes hiding out this week remember bill clintons speech at the charlotte convention in 2012? he effectively laid out the case that the economy had improved dramatically compared to what obama had inherited when he took office in jan 2009 obama himself speaks next week in philadelphia and you can bet he ll try to rebut the picture that trump painted of the economy and the country it is all over but the shouting my ears are still ringing a little bit after trump basically yelled his entire speech a lot of male pundits have taken heat for saying clinton shouts when she talks; these guys ought to call out trump for doing so last night a ton of online buzz was about the yelling to his credit trump again showed he can be self disciplined when he wants to be for a night normally he ad libs in response to a chanting crowd but he mostly kept chugging along and sticking to the script as the crowd chanted “lock her up a mantra of this convention trump didn t take the bait “lets defeat her in november he replied a few minute later a protestor to his left disrupted his speech and held up a sign that said “build bridges not walls trump stood patiently if a little perturbed looking as the crowd drowned her out with chants of “usa at a normal rally he d rile up the audience into a frenzy by yelling “get em out of here! but last night he took a dramatic pause before bellowing “how great are our police? the crowd loved it looking to the next 100 days many republican experts believe trump did little to expand his appeal beyond the base “it may be that this speech was so unusual relentlessly negative and high decibel that it will punch through more the analysts realize national review editor rich lowry writes “but it is hard to believe it is going to widen his appeal he didn t even seem interested in trying to show voters that he has more range than he is shown over the last year this was a trump rally dressed up with fancy trappings and a ballon drop afterwards surely trumps attitude is that this approach got him this far so why change? and that is the gamble of his entire campaign the former communications director for the nrsc a coming out party for the republican party another notable moments from last night that will be remembered was when billionaire paypal founder peter thiel told the convention “i am proud to be gay i am proud to be a republican but most of all i am proud to be an american it was the first declaration of its kind and most of the delegates stood and cheered then in his speech trump referred to the massacre of “49 wonderful americans at a gay nightclub in orlando and promised to “protect our lgbtq citizens the crowd cheered trump paused “as a republican i have to say it is so north carolina to hear you cheering he said what a sea change the official party platform ratified earlier this week continues to oppose gay marriage but the times they are a changin even the running mate trump picked to appeal to social conservatives got in on it while you were sleeping we may find out hillarys versus choice this afternoon even though she is not expected to formally announce her choice until tomorrow the headline in

favorite … since the start the timing kaine has a series of fundraisers scheduled in massachusetts on friday and saturday “if the virginia senator cancels thats a strong indication hes been picked the boston globes annie linskey reports “kaines first fundraiser is set for noon friday at the university of massachusetts club in boston on saturday kaine is scheduled to be on nantucket at the chanticleer garden for a 5 30 pm reception “text messages could not go out from the campaign announcing the pick as soon as friday after an event shes holding here in orlando linskey adds “clinton is appearing at the site of the pulse nightclub shooting this morning making it unlikely that a selection would be announced before then elizabeth warren does not think it is her i think if it was me i d know it by now the massachusetts senator told stephen colbert last night some democrats caution against discounting tom vilsack per john wagner and anne gearan there is a push among some lefties to prevent hrc from picking kaine or vilsack they grumble that the virginian is too close to the financial services industry and the ag secretary is too close to “corporate agri business kaine signed a bipartisan letter just this monday urging the consumer financial protection bureau to “carefully tailor its rulemaking regarding community banks and credit unions so as not to unduly burden these institutions with regulations aimed at commercial banks anne gearan reports “at issue are compliance rules under dodd frank kaine also signed a second letter on behalf of regional banks seeking relief from liquidity reporting requirements critics say both requests help banks of many sizes avoid oversight kaine brushed the criticisms aside “people are going to say whatever they want but i m strongly for the regulation of the financial industry he told reporters in northern virginia “if you spend a lot of time over regulating credit unions and community banks you are basically letting a lot of the big guys off easily kaine also said hes undecided on tpp and still open to voting for it “i see much in it to like he told the intercept calling the deal an “upgrade of labor standards environmental

472,raul a reyes an attorney and member of the usa today board of contributors writes frequently for cnn opinion follow him on twitter @raulareyes the opinions expressed in this commentary are his on monday night bernie sanders finally did what all runners up for a presidential nomination are tasked with doing it is not easy and it certainly is humbling (ask hillary clinton circa 2008) but sanders rose to the occasion at that democratic national convention and gave a full throated public endorsement of his rival clinton before a national audience and the crowd in the wells fargo center in philadelphia the most awaited speaker of the evening took an awfully long time to mention hillary clinton which probably made some clinton advisors a bit nervous he thanked mister obama elizabeth warren his delegates and supporters and donors and the people of vermont among others before finally getting down to business based on her leadership and ideas he said hillary clinton must become president of the united states his cannily crafted speech melded the familiar themes of his stump speech with an endorsement of clinton and it seemed at times in doing so he was allowing his supporters one last moment of collective grief at the end of his movement there were numerous shots of sanders supporters in tears throughout the hall it might have seem unusual to some viewers the amount of time devoted on monday to bringing the party together but remember sanders was a phenomenon and nothing about his run for the nomination was conventional he deserved every second that he took addressing his supporters consider that for all the negative press directed at trumps convention donald trump has received a bounce in national polls since last week so the big questions going into the night was whether sanders would be able to bring his supporters into the clinton camp and whether the dnc could not stage a convincing show of party unity at least on day 1 it looks like the answer is yes on both counts while the democrats still have some healing to do as evidenced by the occasional dueling chants of bernie! versus hillary! and edgier variations on those themes there were significant differences on display between the republican national convention last week and the dnc unlike the rnc every person who took the stage mentioned their partys nominees name and often unlike the rnc there was more diversity on the stage tonight than all week in cleveland and unlike the rnc we saw some serious star power from eva longoria to demi lovato to paul simon sorry chachi monday night also stood in sharp contrast to the rnc because so many of the speakers on stage which included a disabled person latinos immigrants and a muslim american represented some of the very types of people that trump has mocked whats more instead of simply making a case against trump speaker after speaker made the case for clinton this is how conventions should be run and shows smart planning by the dnc perhaps the most courageous moment on monday night one which lit up twitter came improbably from comedian sarah silverman as she and al franken vamped for time before paul simons performance she set off a fresh round of boos and chants with her sudden remark to the bernie or bust people you re being ridiculous! she was right and it was refreshing to hear her stating what so many democrats have been thinking but it was michelle obama who was unquestionably the star of the night she managed to take down trump without ever mentioning his name and she made a rock solid case for clinton i want a president with a record of public service she said before noting as she described the remarkable evolution of the country that she wakes up every day in a house built by slaves michelle obama made the critical point that the president has an impact on our children which is something that undecided voters need to hear she showed restraint and class in not joking about or referencing melania trump very wise and gracious to boot up next elizabeth warren whose job was somewhat akin to following beyonce she was as upfront and persuasive as usual pointing out the dearth of a plan for the country from trump and noting his opposition to the minimum wage and to lowering student debt yet she suffered from following the first lady and on the tail of such an uplifting speech hers felt a bit flat if there was one thing wrong with the program on monday night it was that perhaps michelle obama should have been scheduled last though sanders endorsement was necessary and long awaited it was mister obamas speech that was the real home run her speech was one for the ages and should have closed out day 1 still the overall the messages of inclusion and hope tonight likely left many viewers feeling more optimistic than they did after watching the doomful rnc there were indeed legitimate concerns that the democratic national convention might not kick off with the harmony that the clinton campaign envisioned however as it as it turned out the takeaway from day one of dnc 2016 seems to be that they are one raucous if slightly dysfunctional family.,REAL

1497,theresa crouse november 13 2016 survival pharmacy 9 ways to use ginger for your health ginger has been used for centuries for medicinal and culinary purposes though we don t use it commonly in much american cooking you re likely familiar with pickled ginger when you eat sushi and it is also becoming a popular dried and candied product the medicinal properties and ease of growth make ginger a plant that you should definitely be growing for your survival garden! i ve been growing ginger in a potted plant inside which is the best way to grow it if you live in a small space or a region that gets cold it doesn t like the cold so if you live in a cooler area you need to grow it indoors or outdoors in pots so that you can bring it inside before the frost the actual growing part is easy but first lets clarify something ginger isn t a root; it is a rhizome it does have roots which are the long hairy looking parts that draw in moisture just like roots do for any other plant rhizomes are actually underground parts of the stem they grow horizontally under the ground with roots on the bottom new stems grow from the top to the surface it is the rhizome part that we eat but most people refer to it as ginger root so we ll still do the same ginger rhizomes grow buds or eyes similar to potatoes those are the parts that will grow what part do you plant? planting ginger is similar to planting potatoes; you plant the buds that grow off of the rhizome on a potato we call them eyes you can buy the rhizome at your local garden store or order from a seed store another option is to just allow a ginger root that you buy from the grocery store to bud then plant it one problem with using one from a grocery store is that they re often sprayed with growth inhibitors to keep them from budding while they re on the shelf you can soak the ginger to get as much of this off as possible but you still may have problems getting it to bud if you can then go for it! another problem with using a store bought one is that it may have pesticides or herbicides on it to resolve both problems you could not buy organic it is a bit more expensive but if you can t find anything at your local stores then this is a good option perfect growing conditions ginger likes rich moist soil partial or full shade humidity and warm weather the soil needs to drain well in order for the rhizomes to develop they grow horizontally so they re one of the few plants that flourish in shallow containers i live in florida so my soil is sandy and the weather is of course temperate so i could not plant outside if i wanted to i just scoop soil right out of the ground for my dirt then mix it half and half with compost since i use a pot (actually a rectangular box) and rich soil i don t add any type of fertilizer the plant will only grow 2 3 feet tall and it smells great if you plant it outside in soil thats less than ideal or if you get a lot of rain give it a drink of the fertilizer or compost tea of your choice every couple of weeks or so the reason for this is that when it rains the water washes all the nutrients out of the soil put mulch around it too that helps keep the moisture in and it nourishes the plant as the mulch decomposes it also helps keep out weeds because ginger is pretty delicate and other plants will plow it right over it doesn t like wind either so … to recount no wind no cold no full sun and not too much water instead it likes rich well draining soil moderate moisture and partial sun or shade preparing and planting if your rhizome has more than one bud you can cut it into pieces leaving a bud on each piece then plant them you can also just plant the entire thing let the rhizomes soak overnight then bury them 3 6 inches deep and water sparingly just enough to moisten the soil some people prefer to let them sit in water until the grow roots before they plant them but i haven t found that to be necessary best time to plant is late winter/early spring as long as you re not planting outside in a cold zone if you live in a tropical zone plant it at the end of the dry season/beginning of rainy season you don t need much space to plant enough ginger to get you through the year each rhizome will only produce a few leaves the first year and they don t mind living in close quarters plant them 6 8 inches apart and they ll be fine video first seen on diy home and garden harvesting ginger this is the best part! once your ginger has been growing for three or four months you can trim pieces of the rhizome off of it simply by digging through the soil to the side of the plant and just nipping a piece off the end then covering it back up this green ginger won t be quite as flavorful as ripe ginger but it is still good you can also wait until the end of the season and harvest the ginger when the plant starts to die off this takes about ten months to happen if the temperature allows (or if you re growing inside) you can replant right away harvest all of the ginger break the rhizomes apart and separate out a few that have good buds toss those back in the ground or pot and use the rest ginger freezes well you can also store it for several months in a root cellar slice it thinly and dehydrate it candy it or pickle it if you dry it you can grind it into ginger powder that is great for baking or medicinal use medicinal uses for ginger now we are down the heart of the matter why growing ginger is a good thing for a prepper to do the active ingredient in ginger gingerol is an antibiotic anti viral anti inflammatory and antioxidant it is also an anti coagulant there is a reason ginger is considered a superfood! 1 heart disease and stroke since it is an anti coagulant which means it prevents your blood from clotting it can help you avoid heart attacks and strokes its antioxidant properties also help fight free radicals that cause heart disease so it is a double whammy 2 stomach upset heartburn and other gi problems ginger has been used in holistic medicine for centuries to treat all sorts of upper gastrointestinal problems it is good for stomach upset heartburn constipation bloating and even morning sickness during pregnancy thats because it helps induce the stomach to release its contents into the small intestine it is also effective at treating ulcers this is now officially backed by science i actually use it to get rid of heartburn by eating a slice or two of candied ginger you can also drink it in a tea for quick relief 3 motion sickness though this is going to be a short section it is well warranted because ginger has actually been shown in at least one study to treat motion sickness especially seasickness more effectively than dramamine! ginger doesn t just ease the nausea; it treats all of the symptoms nausea cold sweats and dizziness 4 strengthens immune system interestingly enough gingers beneficial effect on digestion also helps your immune system because in addition to the antioxidants a healthy digestive tract is required for proper nutrient absorption not only that gingerol has the effect of boosting your body temperature maybe thats why gingerbread is so great in the winter!

1552,before a critical round of primaries on tuesday the republican presidential field gathered for a debate in florida site of perhaps next weeks most pivotal contest here are the top takeaways from thursday nights debate you d be forgiven if you assumed thursdays debate would be something akin to a professional wrestling cagematch after all it was just a week ago that trump was not too subtly defending his manhood in response to a recent jab from marco rubio about the size of his hands there was none of that at the university of miami to be sure there were shots at trump and he returned in kind but they were mostly policy oriented rubio hit trump on social security the numbers don t add up he said of trumps proposals both rubio and ted cruz took on the front runner for being insufficiently supportive of israel on israel donald has said he wants to be neutral between israel and the palestinians cruz said as president i will not be neutral thats a far cry from the tone and tenor of recent debates and perhaps a recognition by all the candidates and particularly trump the favorite to emerge as the nominee of a need to change the publics perception of the republican party campaign has voters look ahead to november trump perhaps the ultimate provocateur of the 2016 field seemed almost stunned by what was happening on stage so far i cannot believe how civil it is been up here it doesn t take sophisticated political analysis to understand that rubio needs to win in his home state of florida next tuesday to maintain any semblance of a path forward particularly after poor showings in this weeks contests the florida senator has clearly moved away from the more personal assault on trump an approach he in recent days acknowledged he regretted on thursday night he aimed to take on trump by more by demonstrating a superior understanding of policy whether on entitlements or foreign policy rubio the son of cuban immigrants also sought to draw a contrast with trump on the restoration of relations between the united states and cuba trump said he would ve focused on making a better deal with the communist nation rubio countered heres a good deal cuba has free elections cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out cuba has freedom of the press thats a good deal earlier pushing back against trumps boasts against political correctness the florida senator scored some points with this line i m not interested in being politically correct i m interested in being correct polls paint a bleak picture for rubios hopes of overtaking trump but his more subdued controlled approach to taking on the front runner may at least give voters a glimpse of the candidate who at least for a time seemed to be the republican party establishments best chance cruz and trump haven t found much to agree on recent weeks but they did find common cause on one issue thursday night delegate math i guess there is two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment trump said referring to himself and cruz as the only two republican party hopefuls who can still win the nomination donald is right cruz said there are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination donald and myself indeed trump and cruz are far ahead in the delegate race with the new york billionaire at 458 and cruz with 359 according to the most recent associated press tally more than 200 delegates ahead of rubios 151 cruz clearly wants a one on one battle with trump who likewise doesn t want delegates scattered so widely that it could not increase the likelihood of a contested convention that ultimately turns against him to that end trump laid down a marker for how he thinks the nomination should be decided regardless of whether someone gets secures a majority 1 237 through the primaries which he called a very random number i think that whoever gets the most delegates should win trump said thats what i think ohio gov john kasich like rubio faces a must win in his home state on tuesday in the university of miami debate he sought as he has throughout the campaign to highlight his experience he cited the support he had from 55% of the foreign policy experts in this country and detailed his many years on the house armed services committee he also defended some of his views that aren t exactly in sync with many of the partys most conservative activists on common core he said all i m in favor of in ohio is high standards contrast that with cruz who called common core a disaster on the environment kasich said i do believe we contribute to climate change but i don t think it has to be either you re for some environmental stringent rules or you know you re not going to have any jobs the fact is you can have both these positions might be seen as heretical among some conservatives but if and it is a giant if he can survive in the race long enough for states with larger segments of more moderate voters to hold contests those views could not position him as a more viable alternative to trump or cruz.,REAL

815,this has been a rough year for pollsters and pundits with prediction after prediction going painfully awry even those supposedly unflappable data journalists have found themselves stepping in it but it is not just the journalists and pollsters since i m a professor of statistics as well as a blogger who often comments on academic papers that i think misuse numbers i have a front row seat to some of the least persuasive academic takes on politics and elections and it is been a big year for bad studies in journalism and polling premature obituaries of trump have been one common problem in july 2015 the new york timess nate cohn remarked on a shift that will probably march the moment when trumps candidacy went from boom to bust (that was a reference to trump crudely dismissing the war record of john mccain the former republican presidential nominee) his support will erode cohn wrote confidently as the tone of coverage shifts from publicizing his anti establishment and anti immigration views … to reflecting the chorus of republican criticism of his most outrageous comments and the more liberal elements of his record whoops only a month later famed number cruncher nate silver gave trump a 2 percent chance of winning the republican nomination a couple of months after that gallup made the historic announcement that the organization would no longer do horse race style election polling you can see why this might be a smart time to get out of the predictions game i d love to claim that i m above all this myself but really i too had no idea what would happen during the primary season whenever anyone asked me i d point them to an article i wrote in 2011 explaining why primaries are hard to predict in short in the general election voters have months to make their decisions the choice is between two candidates who are ideologically distinct and most voters can rely on party cues in contrast primaries come in a rushed sequence competing candidates tend to be similar in ideology and (of course) they come from the same party and with multiple candidates comes the opportunity for strategic voting (casting a vote for someone you dislike to defeat someone you dislike even more) which is a hard thing to model in recent years we have seen claims that political attitudes and preferences were determined by menstrual cycles and smiley face icons in short i avoided making any embarrassing predictions about primary election winners only by the tactic of avoiding making predictions period an option that was not so available to the nates cohn and silver who were expected to make real time predictions (and who to their credit examined their errors afterward) but academia has had no shortage of errant findings as well this year perhaps more than others the internet has been swarming with conspiracy theories some of these defended with statistical arguments in june various people pointed me to a paper by axel geijsel and rodolfo cortes barragan graduate students at tilburg university and stanford respectively with the portentous title are we witnessing a dishonest election? a between state comparison based on the used voting procedures of the 2016 democratic party primary for the presidency of the united states of america (yes indeed that presidency) the paper issued before the primary race between hillary clinton and bernie sanders was decided made the case that sanders tended to win in states where electronic voting could not be double checked with a paper trail clinton suspiciously or suspiciously tended to win when there was no paper trail moreover geijsel and barragan wrote the inaccuracy of exit polling supposedly rose in states without a paper trail and the official results seemed biased toward clinton the paper itself did not convince me as there can be all sorts of differences between different states and there is no reason to pick just one of these factors and give it a causal interpretation it is what we call an observational comparison you never know fraud could not always happen but the paper supplied no useful evidence that this difference was the one driving the election results (not that you d need an explanation as to why a 74 year old socialist fails to win a major party nomination in the united states) but if going viral among bernie followers counted in academia these students would have tenure already closer to the mainstream in june economics professors ray fisman and andrea prat of boston university and columbia posted a piece in slate claiming that fox news support for donald trump could not erase a 12 percentage point democratic lead in the popular vote i m skeptical that this number is anything close to reasonable after looking at the cited study by professors gregory martin (political science emory) and ali yurukoglu (stanford business school) it seems to me that fisman and prat improperly extrapolated an estimate that was already probably too high martin and yurukoglu estimated that watching fox news an extra 25 minutes a day increased a voters probability of voting republican by 03 percentage points but it is not reasonable to assume that if the time watching the channel continued to grow the shift in vote preference would continue to be strong and linear all the way to 12 percent! in addition while i trust that the authors found what they reported there is a well known tendency for small but variable effects to be overestimated in this sort of statistical study in general estimates near zero are discarded and high estimates are reported we call this the statistical significance filter which can turn weak results into robust seeming ones regarding partisan news sources i have more trust in a study by political scientists dan hopkins and jonathan ladd of georgetown university who analyze data from a 2000 pre election poll and find a positive effect of fox news on support for george w bush but only for republicans and independents in summarizing this study hopkins writes that media influence fosters political polarization for republicans and pure independents fox news access in 2000 reinforced republican party loyalties not a lot of room for a 12 percent swing in that claim the next month came a piece based on work by the research psychologist robert epstein epstein also publicized it last year called how google could not rig the 2016 election it claimed that googles search algorithm can easily shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent or more up to 80 percent in some demographic groups with virtually no one knowing they are being manipulated … given that many elections are won by small margins this gives google the power right now to flip upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide quite a claim the numbers however came from a highly artificial set of lab experiments in which participants were asked questions about unfamiliar political candidates after being shown unrealistically rigged search results the researchers put extremely biased articles favoring one candidate on page one moderately biased articles on page two and so on so participants had to go to pages four and five of a five page search to find anything strongly favoring the other candidate epstein then compounded his exaggerations by claiming ridiculously that the real world impact of google on elections would undoubtedly be larger than in his loaded experiments in fact the real presidential election is not being held in an isolated lab voters have many sources of information about clinton and trump beyond those found in (hypothetically) rigged search results (full disclosure some of my research is funded by google) and it is still only early september! just wait till next month when just about any election related study will get 15 minutes of fame in recent years we have seen claims that political attitudes and preferences were determined by menstrual cycles smiley faces displayed near survey questions for subliminally short durations and the mood swings caused by the results of college football games (really) all of these studies struck me as flawed either in design or in the analysis of the data (follow the links for more details about my doubts) i m not saying that these studies shouldn t have been done (well in most cases) researchers should be free to try out all sorts of outside the box ideas and indeed in some of these cases i m not criticizing the studies so much as the accompanying hype but respected news organizations should think twice about dramatic claims about voting and elections even if they are published in reputable scientific journals when it comes to research election season is silly season and there always seems to be room for one more story about how irrational those voters are who knows what else they ll come up with before november 8? andrew gelman is a professor of statistics and political science and director of the applied statistics center

4314,(reuters) the trump administration on friday dropped a lawsuit accusing north carolina of discriminating against lgbt residents after the state replaced its “bathroom bill although a key civil liberties group vowed to keep fighting the new law in court in a two sentence court filing the justice department said it had dropped its lawsuit filed last year by the obama administration because the north carolina legislature had replaced it with a new law called house bill 142 the filing marks the first significant move in a complicated legal battle challenging the states nondiscrimination laws since the replacement of the original law known as house bill 2 or more commonly as the “bathroom bill house bill 2s most controversial provision was the requirement that in state run buildings transgender people use the bathrooms changing rooms and showers that corresponded to the sex on their birth certificates rather than their gender identity a number of businesses and sports leagues boycotted north carolina because they saw the year old law as discriminatory against the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender (lgbt) community civil liberties groups also protested the move the american civil liberties union the aclu of north carolina and lambda legal filed a lawsuit challenging the law in march of last year that was followed in may by the justice departments own suit against house bill 2 james esseks the aclus lgbt project director said the new law is flawed because it keeps a ban on cities and counties from creating their own nondiscriminatory ordinaces until 2020 and relegates to the state legislature the power to regulate bathroom access the legislature has purposefully not taken any action to define access he said house bill 142 “leaves transgender people in limbo and thats intentional esseks said “this does not fix the problem it creates confusion esseks said his group planned to amend their lawsuit soon to challenge the new bill.,REAL

758,from the united states to venezuela experience reveals sanders policies wouldn t enrich anyone but a ruling elite it is a common misconception that socialism is about helping poor people actually what socialism does is create poor people and keep them poor and thats not by accident under capitalism rich people become powerful but under socialism powerful people become rich when you look at a socialist country like venezuela you find that the rulers are fabulously wealthy even as the ordinary citizenry deals with empty supermarket shelves and electricity rationing the daughter of venezuelas socialist ruler hugo chavez is the richest individual in venezuela worth billions of dollars according to the miami based diario las américa in cuba fidel castro reportedly has lived pretty much literally like a king even as his subjects dwelt in poverty in the old union of soviet socialist republics as hedrick smith reported in his the russians the communist party big shots had lavish country houses and apartments in town stocked with hand polished fresh fruit even as the common people stood in line for hours at state run stores in the hopes of getting staples there is always a lot of talk about free health care but it is generally substandard for the masses and fancy for the elite (the average cuban or venezuelan peasant or soviet era russian doesn t get the kind of health care that people at the top get) in the old soviet union the new communist nobility whose positions and influence seemed to run in families somehow were called the nomenklatura (from the latin word for a list of names) despite all the talk about equality etc they generally did a lot better than people who didn t have the right connections dissident milovan djilas referred to these managers and apparatchiks (another soviet era word) as the “new class where socialist equality was supposed to eliminate the distinction between exploited workers and peasants and their capitalist exploiters it instead produced a new distinction between exploited workers and peasants and their “new class socialist oppressors well this is old news george orwell explained the phenomenon in his animal farm many decades ago but people keep falling for it like ponzi schemes socialism is an evergreen form of fraud egged on by suckers eager to believe the lies hucksters tell them which brings me to bernie sanders the washington post recently ran a piece originally entitled bernie sanders plans have surprisingly small benefits for americas poorest people among other things it noted that “in general though sanders health care plan would benefit affluent households more than it would poorer ones likewise a paper from the left leaning brookings institution notes that the biggest beneficiaries of bernies free college proposal would be rich kids families from the top half of the income distribution would receive 24% more in dollar value from eliminating tuition than students from the lower half of the income distribution well america isn t socialist though these days we are not really capitalist either if by capitalist you mean a free market economy without much government direction but we do have our own new class and those people tend to be bernie supporters americas new class isn t the super rich (they tend to donate to hillary clinton); it is the upper middle class employees of non profits universities and government agencies they benefit twice from the kinds of programs that bernie supports often they re employed to administer them or receive funds for providing services (think college administrators who unsurprisingly heavily support bernie and hillary) and then they also receive the benefits because their kids are more likely to go to college than say a kroger cashiers (and if we ever wind up with government run health care ask yourself who ll get the hip replacement first a woman who works as a cashier at kroger or a senior bureaucrat in the department of health and human services) higher up the political scale of course the powerful really do become rich bill and hillary clinton are likely worth about 45 dollars million paid a lot for boring speeches given to people who are really just buying influence but at least in america becoming powerful isn t the only way to become rich under socialism you re either powerful or you re poor but poverty isn t a byproduct of socialism it is a requirement as illustrated by cato institute analyst juan carlos hidalgos report concerning venezuela as the rainmakers sang back in the 1980s “they ll turn us all into beggars cause they re easier to please thats socialism in a nutshell the “equality talk?

1054,democratic front runner hillary clinton declared victory in the kentucky primary on tuesday potentially disrupting a string of expected primary losses this month that had threatened to weaken her even as she turned her focus to her likely matchup against republican donald trump in the general election sen bernie sanders of vermont meanwhile was declared the winner of oregons democratic primary the outcomes will do little to change the dynamics in the race in kentucky sanders had hoped to continue a state winning streak that began in indiana and west virginia this month with 998 percent of precincts counted clinton was ahead by less than 1 percentage point and the associated press declared the race too close to call asked whether sanders would consider seeking a recount spokesman michael briggs said in an email “we ll take a closer look at the numbers in kentucky and make a decision on wednesday although sanders had been favored to win kentucky in recent polls clintons advisers sensed an opportunity to pull out a victory and invested heavily in the state in recent days clinton campaigned in kentucky throughout the weekend and senator surrogates to appear on her behalf including former president bill clinton sanders drew large audiences across the state while both clintons at times faced unfriendly crowds in a state that once supported bill clinton overwhelmingly but that in part because of the decline in the coal industry has evolved into a redder state sanders also spent time and money in recent days in other primary states including oregon and california at a rally in carson calif late tuesday sanders said “it appears tonight that we are going to end up with about half of the delegates from kentucky he also declared that winning the nomination remained possible “no one can predict the future but i think we have a real shot to win the primaries in a number of the states coming up he said “don t tell the secretary of state she might get nervous i think we are going to win here in california ahead of voting tuesday sanders trailed clinton by 283 pledged delegates which are awarded based on the results of primaries and caucuses according to the most recent tally by the associated press he would need to win lopsided victories in nearly all of the remaining primaries to overtake her in the delegate count oregon also held democratic and republican primaries tuesday and trump and sanders were declared the winners shortly after the polls closed while those primaries were playing out tuesday sanders was locked in a controversy with democratic party leaders in nevada over the conduct of his supporters at the state convention over the weekend which was cut short after security officials declared they could not no longer contain the disruption the dispute raised the prospects for a contentious nominating convention in philadelphia this summer something that democratic leaders say would be harmful to the party as well as to clintons prospects for preparing to confront trump and like tuesdays close primary results in kentucky the fight also highlighted the never ending nature of the democratic nominating process and the growing hard feelings between democratic party leaders and loyal sanders fans state party officials accused sanders supporters of inciting violence and sending threatening messages to party officials including the state party chairwoman roberta lange afterward pro sanders graffiti was found scrawled on the state party headquarters building the party filed a formal complaint with the democratic national committee about the conduct of sanders supporters on tuesday sanders condemned alleged threats but he also stood by unhappy supporters who had claimed that state convention rules were being carried out unfairly to favor clinton “if the democratic party is to be successful in november it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned sanders said “unfortunately that was not the case at the nevada convention the clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the fracas but democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz (fla) and senate minority leader harry m reid (nev) called on sanders to condemn the violence both primaries on tuesday were open only to registered democratic voters a fact that probably hurt sanders given how strongly he has performed among independent voters in states that held open primaries in kentucky sanders campaigned in the small western city of paducah on sunday drawing nearly 2 000 supporters to a convention center but by the end the clinton campaign had slightly outspent sanders on the airwaves and she made her pitch to kentucky with the help of a well worn weapon nostalgia for her husbands administration “i want to help bring back the kind of economy that worked for everybody in the 1990s clinton said in paducah on monday morning when she dropped by a packed diner to shake hands “i ve already told my husband if i m so fortunate enough to be president and he will be the first gentleman i m expecting him to go to work    and get incomes rising that theme was particularly resonant in kentucky a state where democrats recall bill clinton as the last of an era of southern democrats they identified with culturally “i saw you and your husband when you came through    and you stopped holly erwin 63 told clinton breathlessly in the lone oak little castle diner near paducah “my daughter saved her gum stories like these abound in kentucky but a general move away from democratic leanings particularly among those dependent on the coal industry was a drag on clintons performance kentuckys economy is more diverse than in west virginia where clinton lost to sanders by 16 percentage points last week but clinton didn t help her standing in coal country when in trying to describe her plans to help retool the economy she said she planned “to put a lot of coal companies and a lot of coal miners out of business sanders dominated in coal country in the eastern part of the state returns showed clinton performing well in lexington and louisville two large population centers even as the two candidates continued campaigning for the democratic nomination signs emerged that the general election was already in full swing a pro clinton super pac released two scathing ads monday aimed at the presumptive republican nominee the 6 dollars million ad buy takes aim at trump in a handful of swing states ohio florida virginia and nevada foreshadowing the fight to come over suburban female voters the ads use trumps own words to paint him as insensitive and out of touch at the same time clinton has continued to largely ignore sanders and focus instead on a general election message that contrasts with trumps polarizing candidacy “i m tired of people being on the republican team or the democratic team or the red team or the blue team clinton said monday in hopkinsville ky “lets be on the american team.,REAL

exhibit c is his party affiliation or lack thereof sanders isn t really a democrat he may say he is (sort of) for the purposes of this presidential race but when faced with pleas to step aside for the good of the party he shrugs in his world the “party is the establishment and thats what hes fighting exhibit d is the “what ifs there remains a chance that clinton could not be indicted over her use of a private e mail server and her handling of information now deemed classified while she was secretary of state the financial doings of the clinton family foundation represent more unknown territory with potentially bad optics if clinton were forced from the race sanders would be the last person standing for the democratic nomination true vice president joe biden could not jump in though that would offend many voters sense of fairness especially the sanders voters whose support will be needed in november no matter who wins the democratic nomination exhibit e is history many a pundit has pointed out that in 2008 after a spirited primary season then senator clinton dropped out of the presidential race and embraced her rival barack obama but that didn t happen until june of that year after all the primaries were over then senator obama still won the election so for now at least it is probably too soon to claim that sanders is doing irreparable harm to clintons campaign clinton has high negatives for a likely nominee but the republicans are pounding her much harder than sanders is remember that sanders took one of clintons biggest achilles heels her e mails off the table in their first debate remember also the “pumas of 2008 it is an acronym whose meaning isn t suitable for a family newspaper but it stood for clinton voters claiming they d never vote for obama simply for the sake of “party unity most clinton voters ended up backing obama anyway lets also be clear even if sanders doesn t actually intend to take his challenge of clinton all the way to the convention floor in philadelphia why should he and his strategists say that now? in politics candidates are fully “in it until they re not sanders in a way can already claim victory he has already pushed clinton to the left on trade; chances are she would not have rejected the obama backed trans pacific trade deal absent sanderss objections sanders has also established 15 dollars as the liberal benchmark for raising the minimum wage no doubt a spur toward clintons support for the fight for 15 dollars advocacy campaign clinton prefers to push for a 12 dollars federal minimum wage citing political feasibility but has said she d sign a bill raising the federal minimum wage to 15 dollars sanders says hes waiting to see what a clinton platform looks like before he decides how much to campaign for her in an msnbc interview last week sanders called the process a “two way street suggesting she has to move more toward his philosophy before he ll help her “i want to see the democratic party have the courage to stand up to big money interests in a way that they have not in the past take on the drug companies take on wall street take on the fossil fuel industry and i want to see them come up with ideas that really do excite working families and young people in this country sanders said in an interview on abcs “good morning america last week clinton said that when she dropped out of the 2008 race 40 percent of her supporters were unwilling to vote for obama so she got to work “i nominated him at the convention i went from group to group even as late as the convention convincing people who were my delegates to come together to unify she said it is also worth pointing out that by facing a competitive primary to the bitter end obama was in fighting trim for the general election and organized in all 50 states clinton may not be happy with sanderss continued campaign but he has at least given her a window into how a sizable portion of her partys voters see the world for now sanders holds a lot of power he can join hands with clinton at the convention or he can keep fighting if he chooses the latter path he could not do serious damage to the democratic party but the more likely scenario say democratic strategists is that sanders declares moral victory and backs clinton if not enthusiastically.,REAL

802,this years presidential campaign has proved to be a bleak season for mainstream conservative candidates a story of frustration rejection and disappointment but will that be the end of the story or are revival and redemption still possible? it is possible that rejection of the establishment will be the end of the story it could not happen if donald trump rolls through the iowa caucuses monday goes on to win the feb 9 new hampshire primary handily and uses those two states as a springboard to a big victory in the feb 20 south carolina primary winning that trifecta would put trump in a political category all his own the first republican other than a sitting president to sweep the first three contests on the calendar few candidates go undefeated but at that point many strategists think trump would be extremely difficult to stop en route to one of the most surprising nomination victories of all time [still don t think donald trump can win? this chart should convince you] there is another possible scenario that could not leave the establishment shut out thats one that would start with sen ted cruz (tex) defeating trump here on monday night using that victory to finish second behind trump in new hampshire and subsequently turn south carolina and later contests in march into a two person race advisers to four remaining mainstream candidates former florida governor jeb bush new jersey gov chris christie ohio gov john kasich and sen marco rubio (fla) discount either of those outcomes all see events that would bring one or two of the mainstream conservatives into genuine competition and possible victory what they need is time patience and what all successful politicians have luck “i think it is coming said a strategist for one of these candidates speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a strategic assessment “but it is not going to materialize until the field significantly winnows down    so until the voters get their say in at least one or two states and start the winnowing process themselves i think we are going to be stuck with the bifurcation that we have right now over the past seven months the republican nominating campaign has been mostly about trump or it has been about the rise of the outsiders candidates in addition to trump such as ben carson and carly fiorina who have never held public office and cruz who long has fought the washington establishment mainstream candidates have struggled as never before because there was no next in line candidate no heir apparent among them establishment support splintered pitting the four candidates against one another to squabble among themselves for that portion of the pie and they have been conventional in an unconventional year one strategist described the imbalance in the race to date as “an anti establishment superhighway and an establishment dirt path what is most striking about the assessments of how establishment candidates can get back into the fight is a consensus that it will not happen quickly that it will require the capacity to absorb a series of losses before the dynamic shifts what could not start this process is a surprisingly strong finish by rubio here monday he is hoping for two things that day first and most important is to finish well ahead of fellow establishment candidates bush kasich and christie next and what would conceivably shorten the timeline to put rubio into real contention for the nomination would be his finishing as close as possible to or even overtaking whoever finishes second in iowa at this moment rubio is seen as the candidate with the best chance to emerge from the establishment lane although that comes with significant caveats about whether he lives up to the potential that admirers see in him what could not knock him back would be to fall short of expectations by finishing behind carson in iowa starting tuesday the competition for second in the granite state will be incredibly fierce kasichs team thinks he is the establishment candidate with momentum in new hampshire bushs team thinks his debate performance and polls showing a mash up for second give him an opportunity that did not seem possible two months ago but he must avoid a debilitating finish in iowa christie has spent more time in new hampshire than any of the others but will need an exceptional week of campaigning [john kasich remember him? is on the rise in new hampshire] unless there is a single dominant establishment performance in new hampshire strategists think that at least two mainstream candidates will move on to compete in south carolina possibly all four but primary results can be cruel with the difference between viability in future contests and pressure to get out of the race determined by only a few percentage points no matter what spin the campaigns put on a fourth fifth or sixth place finish a string of losses is rarely a strategy for winning a nomination although in 1992 bill clinton lost 10 of the first 11 contests before starting a winning streak that salvaged his candidacy what gives establishment candidates reason for optimism is that the contests between monday and march 14 will award delegates on a proportional basis a winning candidate might claim momentum but would not be able to amass a big delegate lead over the next six weeks thats why rubios team thinks the survival strategy eventually can be a winning strategy two things will have to happen however one is that establishment money will have to coalesce around a single mainstream candidate so far that has not happened and it probably will not until after super tuesday on march 1 but some strategists think that whoever ends up as the remaining establishment candidate will receive an unprecedented financial windfall sometime in march the second is that significant numbers of republican voters decide they cannot stomach either trump or cruz as the partys nominee and swing decisively behind the remaining establishment candidate right now cruz is the most disliked by the establishment although some mainstream republicans are making themselves more comfortable with the prospect of trump as the nominee others are determined to do everything they can to highlight all the ways in which trumps positions current or past run counter to conservative principles that they say will be easier when he is isolated against a single establishment candidate thats the hope for the beleaguered establishment wing of the republican party their fear is that by the time their moment arrives it could not be too late.,REAL

nationally rubio polls at 16 percent so all he now has to do is knock out ted cruz and win texas (and all of its 155 delegates) and then crush john kasich to make room for ohio (66 delegates) all for the glory of going head to head with trump the candidate of 10 000 flame throwers at which point primary voters across the nation would throw over trump vaulting rubio from third place to first erasing the huge delegate deficit rubio will face after super tuesday it is that simple maybe you re skeptical maybe i m skeptical maybe marco rubio is skeptical hypothetically though we can flesh out a case for how rubio wins how he converts a strategy of second third fourth and fifth place finishes into political triumph here are three main factors to consider from the ephemeral to the arithmetic no one should deny that rubio is a skilled politician who delivers good stump speeches and speaks clearly there is also a sweetness to him that seems hard to fake (hard i say but not impossible) when rubio refers to commercials making fun of his boots or admits he “did not do well in the debate or contrasts himself to a petulant trump and cruz by saying “don t worry i m not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me hes hard to hate his kids are adorable best of all rubio seems sincere even when telling a lie while cruz seems mendacious even when telling the truth i ll note in passing that it is an unfair world to ted cruz and yet cruz deserves it mull that paradox if you like rubios appealing manner has earned him the label of “moderate which is mostly a benefit because even primary voters who are tepid toward rubio might be persuaded to vote for him so the theory goes if they think you might vote for him too (for what it is worth the same great thinking went into nominating john kerry) to be sure however rubio isn t what most of us democrat or republican would call moderate his core portfolio of policies more force abroad more immigration at home bigger tax cuts less government subsidized health care lower social security payments has the support of oh maybe eight or nine ordinary voters but republican party washington and k street love it rubio is a fine new wrapping in which to present the same old butter cookies if anyone can prevent the republican party from having to offer anything other than a new face it is him rubios greatest strength may be a steady detachment from consistency or words as most of us understand them hes not wedded to what most would call “truth or even to what he said yesterday let us continue to be cynical albeit not wrong for a moment candidates take in donations by signaling that they re partially just partially for sale they usually have some core convictions (maybe on the place of faith in public life or the importance of free enterprise or universal health care) and put the rest up for auction views on ethanol subsidies hedge fund taxation tort reform etc this isn t purely sleazy everyone has to raise money in order to run a campaign and most of us have issues we care about and others we don t but rubio stands out for having even fewer if any convictions that appear to be above monetary influence which makes him like a rare earth magnet for donor class bidders want him to change position on amnesty? he ll say he never said he opposed amnesty merely “blanket amnesty he ll publish an op ed in breitbart on wednesday and dismiss the site on saturday as “not a credible source that “we don t even credential with bush out of the way the candidate dubbed the “malleable man of maneuver by pat buchanan (even buchanan detractors must give him points for that phrase) promises to attract torrents of money lets go to the map the next big day of voting is on march 1 also known as super tuesday when 12 states go to the polls presently trump leads in nine of those states; cruz leads in two (texas and arkansas); and colorado last polled in november (ben carson led) is a mystery odds are good then that trump will take at least a third of the 595 delegates at stake and maybe closer to half if we project that rubio doubles his national average and takes a third of the vote (and we must project such things to get him anywhere) then he will be running a close second to trump with about 200 delegates to trumps 300 or so in the following week or two come another bunch of states including michigan where trump leads and kentucky kansas and louisiana where the polling is old and unreliable adding up to about 350 more delegates assuming trump stays in first place and rubio stays in second place perhaps the score would narrow to trump at 400 and rubio at 300 the big day is march 15 of course when some huge winner take all states come into play including florida missouri and ohio trump leads in ohio and john kasich the governor comes second trump also leads in florida with cruz coming in second (rubio is polling at about 14 percent in his home state) rubios most realistic hope to win those contests assumes that trump sabotages himself kasich fades to nothing and cruz drops out otherwise trump handily grabs over 150 delegates from the winner take all contests and maybe a 100 more when the rest are split proportionally if rubio loses florida though and that looks entirely probable it is hard to see him soldiering on but wait the establishment really wants to crush trump and cruz too if possible that leaves one more option for a rubio victory and make no mistake it is the nuclear option if trump fails to secure 1 237 delegates then the nomination process goes into a brokered convention under this scenario the establishment would close ranks and shut down the rebellion once and for all insisting we ll all learn to love rubio rubio rejects this option “i most certainly don t want party insiders deciding this he recently told jake tapper “they didn t want me in the senate but one suspects that republican insiders would find a way to patch things up with the candidate and help him change his mind will any of these things happen? lets just say (and here i also disclose my conflict of interest) that i stand to win 20 dollars if rubio loses the nomination and lose 100 dollars if rubio wins and thats from a 5 1 bet i made with my brother in law back in november so you can see how much faith i have in the man whats more i ve already spent that 20 dollars in my mind you may say i m a dreamer but to judge by the republican party establishments love of the candidate i m not the only one.,REAL

679,the dark agenda behind globalism and open borders by brandon smith when people unfamiliar with the liberty movement stumble onto the undeniable fact of the “conspiracy of globalism they tend to look for easy answers to understand what it is and why it exists most people today have been conditioned to perceive events from a misinterpreted standpoint of “occams razor they wrongly assume that the simplest explanation is probably the right one in fact this is not what occams razor states instead to summarize it states that the simplest explanation given the evidence at hand is probably the right explanation it has been well known and documented for decades that the push for globalism is a deliberate and focused effort on the part of a select “elite; international financiers central bankers political leaders and the numerous members of exclusive think tanks they often openly admit their goals for total globalization in their own publications perhaps believing that the uneducated commoners would never read them anyway carroll quigley mentor to bill clinton and member of the council on foreign relations is often quoted with open admissions to the general scheme the powers of financial capitalism had (a) far reaching aim nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole this system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences the apex of the systems was to be the bank for international settlements in basel switzerland; a private bank owned and controlled by the worlds central banks which were themselves private corporations each central bank… sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans to manipulate foreign exchanges to influence the level of economic activity in the country and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world carroll quigley tragedy and hope the people behind the effort to enforce globalism are tied together by a particular ideology perhaps even a cult like religion in which they envision a world order as described in platos republic they believe that they are “chosen either by fate destiny or genetics to rule as philosopher kings over the rest of us they believe that they are the wisest and most capable that humanity has to offer and that through evolutionary means they can create chaos and order out of thin air and mold society at will this mentality is evident in the systems that they build and exploit for example central banking in general is nothing more than a mechanism for driving nations into debt currency devaluation and ultimately enslavement through widespread economic extortion the end game for central banks is i believe the triggering of historic financial crisis which can then be used by the elites as leverage to promote complete global centralization as the only viable solution this process of destabilizing economies and societies is not directed by the heads of the various central banks instead it is directed by even more central global institutions like the international monetary fund and the bank for international settlements as outlined in revealing mainstream articles like “ ruling the world of money “published by harpers magazine we also find through the words of globalists that the campaign for a “new world order is not meant to be voluntary … when the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system countless people … will hate the new world order … and will die protesting against it when we attempt to evaluate its promise we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents many of them quite gallant and graceful looking people hg welles fabian socialist and author of the new world order in short the house of world order will have to be built from the bottom up rather than f rom the top down it will look like a great booming buzzing confusion to use william james famous description of reality but an end run around national sovereignty eroding it piece by piece will accomplish much more than the old fashioned frontal assault richard gardner member of the trilateral commission published in the april 1974 issue of foreign affairs the new world order cannot happen without us participation as we are the single most significant component yes there will be a new world order and it will force the united states to change its perceptions henry kissinger world action council april 19 1994 i could not quote globalists all day long but i think you get the general idea while some people see globalism as a “natural offshoot of free markets or the inevitable outcome of economic progress the reality is that the simplest explanation (given the evidence at hand) is that globalism is an outright war waged against the ideal of sovereign peoples and nations it is a guerrilla war or fourth generation warfare waged by a small group of elites against the rest of us a significant element of this war concerns the nature of borders borders of nations states and even towns and villages are not just lines on a map or invisible barriers in the dirt this is what the elites and the mainstream media would like us to believe instead borders when applied correctly represent principles; or at least that is supposed to be their function human beings are natural community builders; we are constantly seeking out others of like mind and like purpose because we understand subconsciously that groups of individuals working together can (often but not always) accomplish more that said human beings also have a natural tendency to value individual freedom and the right to voluntary association we do not like to be forced to associate with people or groups that do not hold similar values cultures erect borders because frankly people have the right to vet those who wish to join and participate in their endeavors people also have a right to discriminate against anyone who does not share their core values; or in other words we have the right to refuse association with other groups and ideologies that are destructive to our own interestingly globalists and their mouthpieces will argue that by refusing to associate with those who might undermine our values it is we who are violating their rights see how that works? globalists exploit the word “isolationism to shame sovereignty champions in the eyes of the public but there is no shame in isolation when such principles as freedom of speech and expression or the right to self defense are on the line there is also nothing wrong with isolating a prosperous economic model from unsuccessful economic models forcing a decentralized free market economy to adopt feudal administration through central banking and government will eventually destroy that model forcing a free market economy into fiscal interdependency with socialist economies will also most likely undermine that culture just as importing millions of people with differing values to feed on a nation after it has had socialism thrust upon it is a recipe for collapse the point is some values and social structures are mutually exclusive; no matter how hard you try certain cultures can never be homogenized with other cultures you can only eliminate one culture to make room for the other in a border less world this is what globalists seek to achieve it is the greater purpose behind open border policies and globalization to annihilate ideological competition so that humanity thinks it has no other option but the elitist religion the ultimate end game of globalists is not to control governments (governments are nothing more than a tool) rather their end game is to obtain total psychological influence and eventually consent from the masses variety and choice have to be removed from our environment in order for globalism to work which is a north carolina way to say that many people will have to die and many principles will have to be erased from the public consciousness the elites assert that their concept of a single world culture is the pinnacle principle of mankind and that there is no longer any need for borders because no other principle is superior to theirs as long as borders as a concept continue to exist there is always the chance of separate and different ideals rising to compete with the globalist philosophy this is unacceptable to the elites this has led not so subtle propaganda meme that cultures that value sovereignty over globalism are somehow seething cauldrons of potential evil today with the rising tide of anti globalist movements the argument in the mainstream is that “populists (conservatives) are of a lower and uneducated class and are a dangerous element set to topple the “peace and prosperity afforded by globalist hands in other words we are treated like children scrawling with our finger paints across a finely crafted mona lisa once again carroll quigley promotes (or predicts) this propaganda decades in advance when he discusses the need for “working within the system for change instead of fighting against it for example i ve talked about the lower middle class as the backbone of fascism in the future i think this may happen the party members of the nazi party in germany were consistently lower middle class i think that the right wing movements in this country are pretty generally in this group carroll quigley from dissent do we need it? the problem is that these people refuse to confront the fruits of globalization that can be observed so far globalists have had free rein over most of the worlds governments for at least a century if not longer as a consequence of their influences we have had two world wars the great depression the great recession which is still ongoing too many regional conflicts and genocides to count and the systematic oppression of free agent entrepreneurs inventors and ideas to the point that we are now suffering from social and financial stagnation the globalists have long been in power yet the existence of borders is blamed for the storm of crises we have endured for the past hundred years? liberty champions are called “deplorable populists and fascists while globalists dodge blame like slimy slithering eels? this is the best card the globalists have up their sleeve and it is the reason why i continue to argue that they plan to allow conservative movements to gain a measure of political power in the next year only to pull the plug on international fiscal life support and blame us for the resulting tragedy there is no modicum of evidence to support the notion that globalization interdependency and centralization actually work one need only examine the economic and immigration nightmare present in the eu to understand this so the globalists will now argue that the world is actually not centralized enough thats right; they will claim we need more globalization not less to solve the worlds ailments in the meantime principles of sovereignty have to be historically demonized the concept of separate cultures built on separate beliefs has to be psychologically equated with evil by future generations otherwise the globalists will never be able to successfully establish a global system without borders imagine for a moment an era not far away in which the principle of sovereignty is considered so abhorrent so racist so violent and poisonous that any individual would be shamed or even punished by the collective for entertaining the notion imagine a world in which sovereignty and conservatism are held up to the next generation as the new “original sins; dangerous ideas that almost brought about the extinction of man this mental prison is where globalists want to take us we can break free but this would require a complete reversal of the way in which we participate in society meaning we need a rebellion of voluntary associations a push for decentralization instead of globalization thousands upon thousands of voluntary groups focusing on localization self reliance and true production we must act to build a system that is based on redundancy instead of fragile interdependency we need to go back to an age of many borders not less borders until every individual is himself free to participate in whatever social group or endeavor he believes is best for him as well as free to defend against people that seek to sabotage him; a voluntary tribal society devoid of forced associations of course this effort would require unimaginable sacrifice and a fight that would probably last a generation to suggest otherwise would be a lie i can t possibly convince anyone that a potential future based on a hypothetical model is worth that sacrifice i have no idea whether it is or is not i can only point out that the globalist dominated world we live in today is clearly doomed we can argue about what comes next after we have removed our heads from the guillotine you can read more from brandon smith at his site alt marketcom if you would like to support the publishing of articles like the one you have just read visit our donations page here we greatly appreciate your patronage share this article.,FAKE

sides never especially after the end of the cold war the north koreans fell into a difficult situation and could not not get enough help from china so they determined to help themselves a famine in the mid 1990s that claimed anywhere from 200 000 to three million north koreans was a turning point for the economy forcing private trade on the collectivized state that allowed the north a degree of independence from outside aid and gave credence to the official juche ideology of self reliance china fought alongside north korea during the 1950 53 korean war in which chinese leader mao zedong lost his eldest son and beijing has long been pyongyangs chief ally and primary trade partner while their relationship has always been clouded by suspicion and mistrust china grudgingly tolerated north koreas provocations as preferable to the alternatives chaotic collapse that spills across their border and a korean peninsula under the domain of a us backed seoul government that is also the reason china is reluctant to exert its considerable economic clout worried that measures as drastic as the energy embargo proposed this week by washington could not lead to the norths collapse instead china repeatedly calls for calm restraint and a negotiated solution the north korean government does not provide foreign media with a contact point in pyongyang for comment by email fax or phone the north korean embassy in beijing was not immediately available for comment chinas foreign ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment it has repeatedly spoken out against what it calls the china responsibility theory and insists the direct parties north korea south korea and the united states hold the key to resolving tensions until his death in 2011 north korean leader kim jong il made numerous entreaties to ensure china would back his preferred son as successor while then president hu reciprocated the younger kim in his late 20s at the time began to distance himself from his countrys most powerful ally there is a lot of domestic politics in north korea where this young leader who isn t well known hes not proven yet especially has to show that hes not in the pocket of beijing said john delury of seouls yonsei university i think he made the decision first to keep hu jintao and then (current president) xi jinping really at bay within months of coming to power kim telegraphed north koreas intentions by amending its constitution to proclaim itself a nuclear state the execution of january in 2013 sealed beijings distrust of the young leader of course the chinese were not happy said a foreign diplomat in beijing focused on north korea executing your uncle thats from the feudal ages in an attempt to warm ties xi senator high ranking communist party official liu yunshan to attend the norths october 2015 military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the workers party of korea liu hand delivered a letter from xi praising kims leadership and including congratulations not just from the chinese communist party but xis personal cordial wishes in a powerful show of respect xis overture has been repaid with increasingly brazen actions by pyongyang which many observers believe are timed for maximum embarrassment to beijing sundays nuclear test for example took place as china hosted a brics summit while in may the north launched a long range missile just hours before the belt and road forum dedicated to xis signature foreign policy initiative mao zedongs description of north koreas relationship with china is typically mischaracterised as being as close as lips and teeth his words are better translated as if the lips are gone the teeth will be cold a reference to the strategic importance of the north as a geographical security buffer despite its resentment at the pressure north koreas actions have put it under beijing refrains from taking too hard a line it said little when kim jong uns half brother was assassinated in february at kuala lumpurs airport the half brother kim jong nam had been seen as a potential rival for power in pyongyang and had lived for years in beijing then macau an editorial in chinas influential global times warned after pyongyangs latest nuclear test that cutting off north koreas oil would redirect the conflict to one between north korea and china zhao tong a north korea expert at the carnegie tsinghua center in beijing said north korea was deeply unhappy with chinas backing of earlier un sanctions if china supports more radical economic sanctions that directly threaten the stability of the regime then it is possible that north korea becomes as hostile to china as to the united states (this story has been refiled to remove reference to uncle in paragraph

2376,so if the climate scare mongers can t frighten the adults the next logical step is to heap angst on their children who then frighten (or better pester) the adults into action you need to read this entire story and watch the video near the end of the page finally the united nations environmental programme is spending our money to come out with scary childrens fairy tales about global warming sedena the mother of the sea is featured in the un environmental programmes latest childrens book on global warming entitled tore and the town on thin ice this book tells the story of a young boy named tore who lives in a village in the arctic and is upset when he loses a dog sled race the mother of the sea appears in tores dream and informs him that the thinning ice which caused his loss in the dog sled race was due to man made global warming but that is nothing compared to what it is doing to the mother of the seas own dominion and to all living creatures she sends an owl a polar bear and a whale to scare poor tore into thinking that they will become extinct during his lifetime and that our world is melting from climate changes mostly caused by those bad people in rich countries who are spewing gases in the air from their huge cars air conditioners and the like in the words of the whale children like tore should get good and angry the book ends with a so called facts section blaming climate change on the industrial revolution in europe and north america and singling out the united states in particular for its contribution to the production of carbon dioxide added by humans it claims that climate change will hit the poorer countries hardest while at the same time saying that new york along with other coastal areas could not disappear beneath the waves a psychotherapist a true believer in the climate church nevertheless argues that children should not be targeted by the climate activists it is not good for the children and it is not good for the cause i wish she could not also see that her cause is a phony one but i m glad she is against harming children in the name of it climate change community groups often want to work with children we must get into the schools says someone and there is a nod of agreement it is worth thinking about the psychology behind this why is this idea so appealing? and why is it so damaging?the appeal is clear it is fun working with children they re responsive creative and willing and it is certainly easier than working with white van man frequent fliers or the oil industry the reasons given for working with children are usually two fold we need to influence them while they are young if they understand the issue and the effect of their actions they will grow up finding it natural to care for the environment it is a good way of getting to their parents who can resist their child pleading with them to change the lightbulbs because it will save a polar bear?both reasons are suspect the first reason assumes that instruction at best participatory at worst didactic is the route either to action or to the inculcation of positive values towards the environment there is little evidence for this we know that information based campaigns have a limited impact with adults so why should we expect children to be different? as for values these tend to be formed through experience relationship identification and social systems not through information if the school has an influence on values it will be through its culture ethos and the relationships and experiences it offers not through the information it providesboth reasons also raise direct ethical questions it is easy to engage the sympathies of children with stories of damage to the natural world and images of suffering animals they will identify with but children have very little power of all the sections of society who might make an impact on climate change they have the least influence the least agency the least leverage there is a real risk of raising levels of anxiety amongst children that will not only cause distress in the immediate term but will in the long term lead to those children turning against the environmental causes we hoped they might espousewhen i was 10 a speaker came to my school and told us about food shortages and starvation in the third world i rushed home and explained to my parents that we needed to grow more food i couldn t understand why they wouldn t accede to my idea of banding together with the neighbours and turning all our back gardens into a corn field i was left haunted by images of dying children guilt at my good fortune and the anxiety that feeds on powerlessness in adolescence i became determinedly indifferent to the appeals from 3rd world charities as an adult i have continued to find them difficult to relate towe need to ask what happens to the child whose parents are indifferent to their attempts to get them to act? what happens to the child who is overwhelmed by stories of disasters he or she cannot influence?but the deeper question is why are adults so keen to focus on children? why concentrate on the weakest least influential members of society and ask them to act?got kids? watched as they versus been indoctrinated sorry i mean educated about global warming over the last decade? then you will know what i mean they come home from school moodily depressed about the future of our planet and of course what that means for their own lives whats the point? we are all doomed! why study? why bother getting an education? it is futile sea levels are rising temperatures are soaring soon we will all be living in a polluted hell hole constantly battling the equivalent of the queensland floods or the victorian bushfires year upon year and you want me to waste what precious time i have left studying accountancy? it is called nihilism and it is even more terrifying to witness in your teenage children than hickeys drunkenness truancy insolence idleness bad marks or bullying nihilism or the conviction that life on earth is totally pointless saps the young of their energy their ambition and their will to strive struggle and triumph extract

climate change there are 5 parts to this series this is part 1 an excellent easy to understand piece about the truth surrounding phony climate cooling warming change the pollution resulting from the rapid uncontrolled post war industrial expansion spawned two environmentalist movements one group primarily composed of physical scientists and engineers set about to directly address the pollution problems by developing facilities and legislative controls that have to date virtually eliminated industrial contamination of soil water and aira second group primarily composed of activists with little or no physical science background did nothing but protest against industry without ever having addressed a single environmental problem for which they created a solutionwhile the physical scientists and engineers worked quietly with industry solving the environmental problems the ideology driven environmentalist activists used dramatic alarmist rhetoric to gain media control and have become a dominant political force capable of forcing their self serving ideologies on the general public with impunitythe earth entered a cooling phase in 1942 and by 1970 the environmentalists found a way to blame this cooling on industrial expansion the concept was that particulate matter from fossil fuel usage was blocking energy from the sun giving this cooling effect this concept was incorporated as a parameter in the crude climate models of the time and the predictions from models run by james hansen in 1971 projected fifty years of further cooling from the increased use of fossil fuelsonly four years later and in spite of the continued increase in fossil fuel usage global cooling came to an end proving that the models did not have a proper physical basis for relating fossil fuel usage to global coolingby 1988 after 13 years of global warming the ideological environmentalists developed a new tact for blaming fossil fuels the british government had embarked on a political campaign to promote their nuclear industry and attack the powerful coal unions by creating alarmist scenarios of runaway global warming resulting from co2 produced by coal and other fossil fuels this was entirely political in nature with absolutely no scientific backing but it did make the perfect weapon for the environmentalists to promote their anti energy (and anti humanity) ideology all that was needed was some scientific justificationas was done in 1971 climate models which were now far more sophisticated provided the science backing instead of blaming fossil fuels for blocking incoming solar radiation the models removed this parameter and replaced it with a newly contrived parameter that now related global warming to the effect of fossil fuel sourced co2 on the outgoing thermal radiation from the earththis model also produced by james hansen projected warming for the next century because of the fossil fuel co2 emissions that were increasing at a continued accelerated rate as with the 1971 model the 1988 model was proven to be false when global warming ended after 1998 even as co2 emissions continued to rise at unprecedented rates to make matters worse since 2002 the earth has been cooling making all of the projections clearly in the wrong directionby even the most basic standards of ethical science models that first predict cooling from fossil fuel usage that are discredited just four years later when warming occurs with increased usage and then predict warming from fossil fuel usage and are again discredited ten years later as cooling reoccurs with increased usage would be declared absolutely invalid; but when ideology is involved science protocol is totally abandonedimpact 2009as a result of the alarmist predictions of the 1988 climate models of hansen the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) was formed under the auspices of the united nations this body was given a science mandate to investigate the possibility of human effects on climate to determine if the projections of hansen were validthe true nature of the ipcc was not that of a science based body but that of a political body to give scientific legitimacy to false alarmist predictions in order to meet a political self serving environmentalist agenda since its inception the ipcc has used its position of authority to promote its agenda to the detriment of science and even more importantly to the detriment of the global populationfrom 1997 to 1998 the average global temperature increased by over half a degree c and from 1998 to 1999 the average global temperature fell by over half a degree c this was due to an extraordinary el ni o and has nothing to do with either the greenhouse effect or co2 emissions (co2 emissions increased from 24gt/y in 1997 to 242gt/y in 1998 to 244gt/y in 1999)an honest scientific body would have made some sort of statement to this effect but the ipcc in their 2001 third assessment report and particularly in their summary for policy makers for this report not only made no mention of the fact that from 1998 to 1999 the earth cooled more than it had ever cooled during the entire global temperature record but emphatically stated that from 1997 to 1998 the earth had warmed more than it ever hadthis is an absolute violation of science ethics because the policy makers were purposely misinformed with alarmist rhetoric this same 2001 report also stated that the observed global warming for the past century which they stated was attributable to co2 emissions was measured at 060 c + 020 c this is only 06 c per year making the el ni o temperature spike over eighty times greater than what the ipcc stated was attributable to co2 emissions so it is clear that this was stated for the purpose of politically motivated alarmism and not to properly convey information in a scientifically justified mannerthe 2001 ipcc report also included the infamous mbh98 hockey stick temperature proxy which used physical temperature measurement data up to and including 1998 which gave the alarmist impression of twice the 20th century warming because 1999 was not includedthe hockey stick graph became the pivotal evidence that convinced governments around the world to ratify the kyoto protocol that has resulted in such detrimental effects to the global population and global economyin this regard the el ni o temperature spike of 1998 may be considered the most significant climate event in recent history and when one considers the hundreds of millions of the worlds poorest people starving because of kyoto biofuel initiatives that has literally taken their food away and made it into kyoto friendly fuel this el ni o might also be considered the most tragic climate event as wellthrough diligence and hard work physical scientists were able to correct most of the environmental problems that had been created through industrialization but there is no scientific effort capable of undoing the damage caused to the global population by the ideological environmentalists this issue is now out of the hands of the scientists and the only salvation for the global population is the media who must readopt their lost journalistic integrity and expose the true nature of this global fraud.,FAKE

genius account thank you so much i am so thrilled to be back in reno thank you! i have to say i know when i m here in reno i m the other hillary and i am more than okay with that because i think your mayor is doing a terrific job and the fact that she herself is a small business woman and committed to really lifting up reno and giving everybody in this great city the biggest little city with a big heart a chance to get ahead and stay ahead i could not not be more honored than to have her support and endorsement in this race so thank you so much mayor schieve and let me also thank dr karen hilgerson and everybody here at truckee meadows community college i love community colleges and i know something about what this college is doing to give people of all ages not just young people a real chance to get the skills and opportunities that everybody in america deserves so thank you i have to begin by saying my original plan for this visit was to focus on our agenda to help small businesses and entrepreneurs this week we proposed new steps to cut red tape and taxes to make it easier for small businesses to get the credit they need to grow and hire i want to be a small business president my father was a small business man and i believe that in america if you can dream it you should be able to build it and so we ll be talking a lot more about small business and about our economic plans in the days and weeks ahead but today here in this community college devoted to opening minds and creating great understanding of the world of which we live i want to address something that i am hearing about from americans all over our country everywhere i go people tell me how concerned they are by the divisive rhetoric coming from my opponent in this election and i understand that concern because it is like nothing we ve heard before from a nominee for president of the united states from one of our two major parties from the start donald trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia he is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the republican party his disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous in just this past week under the guise of “outreach to african americans trump has stood up in front of largely white audiences and described black communities in such insulting and ignorant terms “poverty rejection horrible education no housing no homes no ownership crime at levels nobody has seen right now he said you walk down the street and get shot those are his words but when i hear them i think to myself how sad donald trump misses so much he doesn t see the success of black leaders in every field the vibrancy of black owned businesses the strength of the black church he doesn t see the excellence of historically black colleges and universities or the pride of black parents watching their children thrive and he apparently didn t see police chief brown on television after the murders of five of his officers conducting himself with such dignity he certainly doesn t have any solutions to take on the reality of systemic racism and create more equity and opportunity in communities of color and for every american it really does take a lot of nerve to ask people hes ignored and mistreated for decades “what do you have to lose? because the answer is everything now trumps lack of knowledge or experience or solutions would be bad enough but what hes doing here is more sinister trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters it is a disturbing preview of what kind of president he d be and thats what i want to make clear today a man with a long history of racial discrimination who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far dark reaches of the internet should never run our government or command our military ask yourself if he doesn t respect all americans how can he serve all americans? now i know some people still want to give trump the benefit of the doubt they hope that he will eventually reinvent himself that there is a kinder gentler more responsible donald trump waiting in the wings somewhere because after all it is hard to believe anyone let alone a nominee for president could not really believe all the things he says but the hard truth is there is no other donald trump this is it maya angelou a great american whom i admire very much she once said “when someone shows you who they are believe them the first time well throughout his career and this campaign donald trump has shown us exactly who he is we should believe him when trump was getting his start in business he was sued by the justice department for refusing to rent apartments to black and latino tenants their applications would be marked with a “c “c for “colored and then rejected three years later the justice department took trump back to court because he hadn t changed and the pattern continued through the decades state regulators fined one of trumps casinos for repeatedly removing black dealers from the floor no wonder the turn over rate for his minority employees was way above average and lets not forget trump first gained political prominence leading the charge for the so called “birthers he promoted the racist lie that president obama is not really an american citizen part of a sustained effort to delegitimize americas first black president in 2015 trump launched his own campaign for president with another racist lie he described mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals and he accused the mexican government of actively sending them across the border none of that is true oh and by the way mexicos not paying for his wall either if it ever gets built you can be sure that american taxpayers will be stuck with the bill but there has been a steady stream of bigotry we all remember when trump said a distinguished federal judge born in indiana couldn t be trusted to do his job because quote “hes a mexican think about that the man who today is the standard bearer of the republican party said a federal judge who by the way had a distinguished record as us attorney had to go in hiding because mexican drug gangs were after him who has mexican heritage but just like me was born in this country is somehow incapable of doing his job solely because of his heritage even the republican speaker of the house of representatives paul ryan described that and i quote as “the textbook definition of a racist comment to this day trump has never apologized to judge curiel but for trump that is just par for the course this is someone who retweets white supremacists online like the user who goes by the name “white genocide tm trump took this fringe bigot with a few dozen followers and spread his message to 11 million people his campaign famously posted an anti semitic image a star of david imposed over a sea of dollar bills that first appeared on a white supremacist websites the trump campaign has also selected a prominent white nationalist leader as a delegate in california and they only dropped him under pressure when asked in a nationally televised interview whether he would disavow the support of david duke a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan trump wouldn t do it and only later again under mounting pressure did he backtrack and when trump was asked about anti semitic slurs and death threats coming from his supporters he refused to condemn them through it all he has continued pushing discredited conspiracy theories with racist undertones you remember he said that thousands of american muslims in new jersey cheered the 9/11 attacks they didn t he suggested that ted cruzs father was involved in the kennedy assassination now perhaps in trumps mind because mr cruz was a cuban immigrant he must have had something to do with it and there is absolutely of course no evidence of that just recently trump claimed that president obama founded isis and he has repeated that over and over again his latest paranoid fever dream is about my health all i can say is donald dream on this is what happens when you treat the national enquirer like gospel they said in october i d be dead in six months it is what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones who claims that 9/11 and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs he even said and this really is just so disgusting he even said the victims of the sandy hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there i don t know what happens in somebodys mind or how dark their heard must be to say things like that but trump didn t challenge those lies he actually went on jones show and said “your reputation is amazing i will not let you down this from the man wants to be president of the united states you know i ve stood by president obamas side as he made the toughest decisions a commander in chief has to make in times of crisis our country depends on steady leadership clear thinking calm judgment because one wrong move can mean the difference between life and death i know we have veterans here and i know we have families mothers and spouses of people currently serving the last thing we need in the situation room is a loose cannon who can t tell the difference or doesn t care to between fact and fiction and who buys so easily into racially tinged rumors someone so detached from reality should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come that is yet another reason why donald trump is simply temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states now i hear and i read some people who are saying that well his bluster and his bigotry is just over heated campaign rhetoric an outrageous person saying outrageous things for attention but look at his policies the ones that trump has proposed they would put prejudice into practice and don t be distracted by his latest attempts to muddy the waters he may have some new people putting new words in his mouth but we know where he stands he would form a deportation force to round up millions of immigrants and kick them out of the country he d abolish the bedrock constitutional principle that says if you re born in the united states you re an american citizen he says that children born into undocumented parents in america are “anchor babies and should be deported millions of them and he d ban muslims around the world billions of them from entering our country just because of their religion think about that for a minute how would it actually work? so people landing in us airports would line up to get their passports stamped just like they do now but in trumps america when they step up to the counter the immigration officer would ask every single person “what is your religion? and then what? what if someone says “i m a christian but the agent doesn t believe him do they have to prove it? how would they do that? really ever since the pilgrims landed on plymouth rock america has distinguished itself as a haven for people fleeing religious persecution believing in religious freedom and religious liberty under donald trump america would distinguish itself as the only country in the world to impose a religious test at the border come to think of it there actually may be one other place that does that the so called islamic state the territory that isis controls what a would be a cruel irony that someone running for president would equate us with them don t worry some will say as president trump will be surrounded by smart advisers who will rein in his worst impulses so when a tweet gets under his skin and he wants to retaliate with a cruise missile maybe cooler heads will convince him not to but look at who hes put in charge of his campaign trump likes to say he only hires the “best people but hes had to fire so many campaign managers it is like an episode from the apprentice the latest shake up was designed to quote “let trump be trump to do that he hired stephen bannon the head of a right wing website called breitbartcom as campaign ceo to give you a flavor of his work here are a few headlines they ve published “would you rather your child had feminism or cancer? “hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage that one came shortly after the charleston massacre when democrats and republicans alike were doing everything they could not to heal racial divides breitbart tried to enflame them further just imagine donald trump reading that and thinking “this is what i need more of in my campaign bannon has nasty things to say about pretty much everyone this spring he railed against paul ryan for quote “rubbing his social justice catholicism in my nose every second no wonder hes gone to work for trump the only presidential candidate ever to get into a public feud with the pope it is truly hard to believe but according to the southern poverty law center which tracks hate groups breitbart embraces “ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right this is not conservatism as we have known it this is not republicanism as we have know it these are race baiting ideas anti muslim and anti immigrant ideas anti woman all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the alt right now alt right is short for “alternative right the wall street journal describes it as a loose but organized movement mostly online that “rejects mainstream conservatism promotes nationalism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity the de facto merger between breitbart and the trump campaign represents a landmark achievement for the “alt right a fringe element has effectively taken over the republican party and this is part of a broader story the rising tide of hardline right wing nationalism around the world just yesterday one of britains most prominent right wing leaders a man named nigel farage who stoked anti immigrant sentiments to win the referendum to have britain leave the european union campaigned with donald trump in mississippi farage has called for a bar on the children of legal immigrants from public schools and health services has said women are and i quote “worth less than men and supports scrapping laws that prevent employers from discriminating based on race thats who donald trump wants by his side when he is addressing an audience of american voters and the grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism is russian president vladimir putin now hes standing on the same stage as the republican nominee trump himself heaps praise on putin and embraces pro russian policies he talks casually of abandoning our nato allies recognizing russias annexation of crimea and of giving the kremlin a free hand in eastern europe more generally american presidents from truman to reagan have rejected the kind of approach trump is taking on russia we should too now all of this adds up to something we ve never seen before of course there has always been a paranoid fringe in our politics a lot of it rising from racial resentment but it is never had the nominee of a major party stoking it encouraging it and giving it a national megaphone until now on david dukes radio show the other day the mood was jubilant “we appear to have taken over the republican party one white supremacist said duke laughed no there is still more work to do he replied so no one should have any illusions about whats really going on here the names may have changed racists now call themselves “racialists white supremacists now call themselves “white nationalists the paranoid fringe now calls itself “alt right but the hate burns just as bright and now trump is trying to rebrand himself as well but don t be fooled there is an old mexican proverb that says “tell me with whom you walk and i will tell you who you are we know who trump is a few words on a teleprompter won t change that he says he wants to “make america great again but more and more it seems as though his real message seems to be “make america hate again and this isn t just about one election it is about who we are as a nation it is about the kind of example we want to set for our children and grandchildren next time you see trump rant on television think about all the children listening across america kids hear a lot more than we think parents and teachers are already worried about what they re calling the “trump effect they report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools especially targeting students of color muslims and immigrants at a recent high school basketball game in indiana white students held up trump signs and taunted latino players on the opposing team with chants of “build the wall! and “speak english after a similar incident in iowa one frustrated school principal said “they see it in a presidential campaign and now it is ok for everyone to say this we wouldn t tolerate this kind of behavior and we wouldn t tolerate it in our own homes and we should not stand for it from a presidential candidate you know my friends this is a moment of reckoning for every republican dismayed that the party of lincoln has become the party of trump it is a moment of reckoning for all of us who love our country and believe that america is better than this twenty years ago when bob dole accepted the republican nomination he pointed to the exits and told any racists in the party to get out the week after 9/11 george w bush went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that muslims “love america just as much as i do in 2008 john mccain told his own supporters they were wrong about the man he was trying to defeat senator mccain made sure they knew barack obama he said is an american citizen and a decent person we need that kind of leadership again we can have our disagreements and believe me i understand that i think thats healthy we need good debates but we need to do it in a respectful way not finger pointing and blaming and stirring up this bigotry and prejudice every day more americans are standing up and saying “enough is enough including a lot of republicans and i am honored to have their support and i promise you this with your help i will be a president for democrats republicans and independents for those who vote for me and for those who vote against me i will be a president for all americans because i truly believe we are stronger together and this is a vision for the future rooted in our values and reflected in a rising generation of young people the young people in america today are the most open diverse and connected we ve ever seen how many of you saw the olympics? i was so proud i always get carried away every time the olympics are on and you look at the diversity of our athletes just look at our fabulous olympic team representing the united states of america like ibtihaj muhammad an african american muslim from new jersey who won the bronze medal in fencing with grace and skill would she even have a place in donald trumps america? and i ll tell ya when i was growing up in so many parts of our country simone manuel would not have been allowed to swim in the same public pool as katie ledecky and now together on our swimming team they re winning olympic medals as teammates i don t know about you but i don t think we have a person to waste we want to build an america where every person has a place where if you work hard and do your part you can get ahead and stay ahead thats the basic bargain of america and we cannot get to where we need to be unless we stand together and stand up against prejudice and paranoia and prove once and for all that america is great because is america is good thank you all lets go out and win the election may god bless the united states and bless you!.,REAL

676,panama city florida (cnn) donald trump is tearing the grand old party apart the tension that has simmered in the republican party for years shutting down the government and nearly bringing the nation to default escalated into an outright civil war tuesday the conflict not only threatens the partys ability to make any realistic attempt at reclaiming the white house next month but also previews the conflicts and divides that could not consume the republican party for years to come if trump loses on one side is trump who spent much of tuesday lashing out on social media at his republican party foes such as speaker paul ryan and sen john mccain and lamenting the lack of party unity hes backed by conservative lawmakers including iowa rep steve king and the throngs of loyal supporters who attend his rallies including the one here in panama city florida tuesday where he renewed his call for a government investigation into his opponent hillary clinton some are even raising the potential of denying ryan the speakership after the election on the other side is ryan who is devoting the full resources of his stature to maintaining a congressional majority that dominance of capitol hill is suddenly threatened and not just in the senate where there are many competitive races but also in the house where the republican party majority was considered untouchable until recently the infighting sparked by the release friday of a 2005 video depicting trump describing women in vulgar and sexually aggressive terms isn t likely to ease in the 27 days before election day trump made clear tuesday that if he loses in november he won t go down quietly or alone he began the day with a series of shots taken over twitter at ryan saying it is hard to do well when the speaker isn t supportive he followed up about an hour later calling ryan a weak and ineffective leader and nearly two hours after that trump posed his most explosive tweet of the day shackles have been taken off me trump continued his attacks on ryan wednesday during a rally in central florida where he said hes at a disadvantage when you have leadership not putting their weight behind the people he also complained about getting no credit from party leaders for his sunday night debate performance wouldn t you think paul ryan would call and say good job? he said it got just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country you d think they d say great going don lets beat this crook no he doesn t trumps turn on his own party may seem counterproductive it hardly allows him to improve his chances of catching clinton but it does allow him the satisfaction of vengeance against party leaders he believes have never treated him fairly since his stunning outsider campaign captured the nomination earlier this year and by blaming republican leaders for their failure to wholeheartedly endorse his campaign trump also opens up the possibility of a face saving excuse if he crashes to defeat in november but the cost to the republican party of trumps burn it down around him strategy is already high could not become more extreme and potentially leave the republican party badly damaged long after he has left the political scene to begin with the estrangement between trump and the party leaders is blowing open a gaping split between the partys grass roots and its establishment leaders that republican national committee chairman reince priebus and others worked so hard to bridge over the summer it is a divide that will be hard to overcome if trump loses the election forging unity could not be impossible if hordes of trump voters blame party leaders for the defeat of a man who electrified the grass roots supporters in a way no other republican has managed in decades king the iowa republican congressman warned tuesday that a purge of party elites might be necessary saying the establishment wing of the party could not simply be amputated out in this effort thats going on right now they ve gone so far out on this limb king said on the laura ingraham radio show the meltdown in the republican party is the culmination of forces that have been building for years intense antipathy towards congressional leaders over their failure to more forcefully oppose president barack obama gave rise to the tea party and senator waves of anti establishment lawmakers to washington in successive elections trumps adoption of a factually challenged style of campaigning would have been impossible without the power of conservative media that has been building for decades and is now fused with the republican party presidential ticket through the role of stephen bannon the head of breitbart news who serves as the ceo of the trump campaign trumps turn against his own party could not also reverberate in down ballot races republicans have long known that their hold on the senate was tenuous whoever ran at the top of their ticket but trumps slumping poll numbers now threaten to drag down vulnerable incumbents too at the very least a trump implosion that cuts deeply into ryans majority could not complicate the speakers already tough task of corralling his volatile majority coalition if an anti trump landslide sweeps away house republican party members in more moderate districts it could not hand more relative power to the ultra conservative freedom caucus and give him the same kinds of fits that it imposed on john boehner his predecessor the dilemma is especially difficult for republican senators running for re election some are rejecting trump because of revulsion at his remarks among more moderate voters but at the same time they risk alienating trump supporters in statess where the former reality star racked up high margins in the primary race new hampshire sen kelly ayotte fits into this category and her desperate effort to walk the fine line between condemning and embracing trump during this election has become a symbol of the wider republican party conundrum ayotte finally said she could not not vote for trump after the video emerged on friday but another star of the republican party florida sen marco rubio said tuesday hes not yet ready to back away from trump rubio looks certain to need trump voters to maintain his narrow lead in his re election race but at the same time if more explosive video emerges about trump rubio who has presidential ambitions in his future risks being tarnished by association with the republican nominee another lawmaker in a tough re election race who is hedging his bets is north carolina republican party sen richard burr who said that while trumps comments were indefensible he still plans to support him for her part the turmoil consuming the republican party would seem to provide a substantial boost to clintons white house bid an nbc news/wall street journal poll released tuesday found the democratic nominee enjoying a 9 point lead among likely voters in a four way race but her aides caution against excessive optimism there is concern inside the campaign that an increasingly negative race which could not only become darker in the days ahead could not turn off voters and make them less likely to show up at the polls in that instance a lower turnout could not create an advantage for trump this seems to be their strategy disgust everyone with our democratic dialogue so that they won t come out to the polls john podesta clintons campaign chairman told reporters tuesday i think it is very unbecoming a presidential candidate

be asking trump about his tax returns given how successfully democrats exploited romneys filings to alienate potential voters democrats essentially called romney a tax cheat for his low rates and the attack stuck and it is a line in some form or another which democrats will be sure to repeat against the billionaire trump if he becomes the republican nominee romney began releasing his tax returns amid pressure from his rivals in early republican primaries in 2012 but because trumps rivals have neglected to actually attack the frontrunner very much trump is only just now being pressed on this crucial general election issue romneys troll timing is perfect trump is either less than a week away from starting to put the republican nomination in the bag or facing lengthening odds in his unlikely but so far successful quest he is also facing tonight what promises to be his most challenging debate yet trumps detractors to this point have mostly knocked trump for insufficient conservativeness or flip flopping or being of poor character but voters primarily interested in conservative orthodoxy and personal virtue are probably not part of trumps long term coalition trumps voters don t seem to care about his politics they just want a winner what few have hit the frontrunner on are his business failures and the unhappy chapters of his career his business troubles and his finances have been a long running part of trumps media feuds in the past but have oddly not been part of the political discussion it is particularly odd given how much of a focus romneys relatively

240,in the closing weeks of the presidential race hillary clintons campaign says it is stepping up its efforts to court white working class men with whom support for republican donald trump as well as dislike of the democratic nominee runs deep evidence of the renewed push can be found on clintons calendar she plans to make her second visit to ohio on monday in as many weeks after shunning the state for much of september among the battleground states it has been one of trumps strongest bastions of support largely because of blue collar workers who have gravitated toward his message of job creation and better trade deals after sundays second debate the clinton camp also plans to intensify deployment of surrogates to pockets of the country where it sees opportunities to win back disaffected democrats aides say that former president bill clinton will embark on more bus tours probably including one in heavily white iowa like the one he just completed through areas of ohio struggling because of the loss of manufacturing and mining jobs others also being dispatched to make the case in rust belt states and beyond include sen bernie sanders of vermont whose focus on economic inequality resonated with white working class men during the democratic primaries to a greater degree than clintons message [in hard luck youngstown bill clinton makes an appeal to the common man] clinton has made similar overtures without moving the dial much immediately after the democratic convention she and her running mate sen tim kaine of virginia embarked on a bus tour through rural pennsylvania and ohio and in august clinton used a high profile speech in michigan to argue that trumps appeal to economically beleaguered americans was a fraud but clinton aides argue that they could not find a more receptive audience now amid a fresh set of trump controversies including revelations that he might have gone many years without paying income taxes and that in recent construction projects he opted to buy his steel from chinese manufacturers rather than us companies based in rust belt states the emergence friday of a video in which trump speaks in particularly lewd terms about women could not also factor in to the way voters see the race “we see an opportunity to make a renewed push with these working class voters who ve been open to donald trump said clinton press secretary brian fallon “there is been a lot to call into question whether he really shares their values the effort could not have an additional effect for clinton which is to at least give the appearance that her appeal extends beyond the democratic base fallon stressed that the stepped up outreach to white working class voters would not supplant the campaigns focus on turning out its base of support which includes african americans latinos and college educated whites particularly women “while we feel like we can win with the coalition of support we ve already built assuming they turn out we ll also be going on the offense in these closing weeks he said [clinton tries to undermine central premise of trumps campaign that he would help struggling americans] the campaign plans to emphasize long standing pocketbook initiatives that aides argue are more in line with the interests of working class voters than anything trump has put forward but which have not fully broken through the clutter of a mutually negative campaign among them increasing the minimum wage requiring employers to provide family leave and taking steps to make college more affordable the pitch will be backed up by some of clintons closing advertising in battleground states aides said bill clintons travels through ohio this week and other appearances around the country have offered one version of the message speaking last month in nevada a state that has been relatively slow to recover from the recession he sought to frame the election as a choice between a candidate who has served others her entire life and is offering solid policy proposals and one who is appealing to a sense of “road rage in the country a washington post abc news poll late last month showed trump leading clinton by 32 percentage points among likely voters without a college degree 62 percent to 30 percent the gap was even more pronounced among men in this group which trump led 76 percent to 17 percent those numbers approach but do not quite mirror the advantage that clinton enjoys among african americans a group that trump has tried to court without much notable progress many of the white working class voters are not only disinclined to vote for clinton but they also strongly dislike her in a more recent post abc poll that followed the first presidential debate 73 percent of white americans without a college degree said they have an unfavorable impression of clinton sixty one percent said their view of the former secretary of state is “strongly unfavorable scott reed a longtime republican operative who managed bob doles 1996 presidential campaign said part of clintons problem is a lack of a focused message to reach the demographic “i haven t seen a clinton message to blue collar voters about economic growth said reed who is now chief strategist for the us chamber of commerce “i think that is still a big challenge for her he added that trump has fallen short in this regard as well but reed said “trump turned out a lot of reagan democrats during the primary and hes doing pretty well with them now joe trippi a longtime democratic strategist said he thinks it is smart for clinton to try to reach a demographic that includes many people who have voted democratic in the past and may not be enchanted with trump either even modest gains among working class voters cuts into the coalition trump would need to win trippi said if nothing else a sustained effort by clinton could not force trump to spend more time defending his base “it is sort of a twofer strategy trippi said “she may be able to win some of them and also force him to spend resources and time guarding support he already has in that sense it doesn t matter if it is a head fake or not trippi who is not working for the clinton campaign also argued that there are potential longer term benefits to reaching out to a demographic group that views her so negatively “the country is so polarized right now he said “if she wins shes going to have to govern so it is to her benefit to reach out to people now who are moving in the other direction.,REAL

primary rival bernie sanders and his campaign the ap released its updated tally showing the former secretary of state winning enough delegates to become the first woman to top a major partys presidential ticket on the eve of the last major day of primary voting the ap said clinton reached the 2 383 delegates needed to become the presumptive democratic nominee with a weekend victory in puerto rico and late burst of support from superdelegates those are party officials and officeholders many of them eager to wrap up the primary free to support whichever candidate they want we really need to bring a close to this primary process and get on to defeating donald trump said nancy worley a superdelegate who chairs alabamas democratic party and provided one of the last endorsements to

are six states that are voting tuesday with millions of people heading to the polls and hillary clinton is working to earn every vote we look forward to tuesday night when hillary clinton will clinch not only a win in the popular vote but also the majority of pledged delegates the sanders campaign rejected the declaration that clinton had clinched the party nod citing its longstanding position that the superdelegates should not count until they actually vote at the convention as they are free to switch sides before then there is nothing to concede sanders told ktvu late monday at a rally in san francisco secretary clinton will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to win the democratic nomination she will be dependent on superdelegates they vote on july 25th so right now our goal right at this moment [is to] do everything we can to win the primary tomorrow sanders spokesman michael briggs accused the media of “a rush to judgement and ignoring the democratic national committees clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that bernie is by far the strongest candidate against donald trump briggs said on monday sanders supporters expressed disappointment that the calls were made before californias primary

the rally said another attendee patrick bryant of san francisco it is what bookies do they call fights before they re over house minority leader nancy pelosi endorsed clinton during an interview on “good morning america before her home states primary i m a voter in california and i have voted for hillary clinton for president of the united states and proud to endorse her for that position pelosi said though adding it is not over until it is over clinton has won 1 812 pledged delegates in primaries and caucuses she also has the support of 571 superdelegates according to an associated press count the ap surveyed all 714 superdelegates repeatedly in the past seven months and only 95 remain publicly uncommitted all the superdelegates counted in clintons tally have unequivocally told the ap they will back her at the convention and not change their vote since the start of the aps survey in late 2015 no superdelegates have switched from supporting clinton to backing sanders clintons presumptive victory monday came nearly eight years to the day after she conceded her first white house campaign to barack obama back then she famously noted her inability to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling campaigning this time as the loyal successor to obama clinton fended off a surprisingly strong challenge from vermont sen sanders he mobilized millions with a fervently liberal message and his insurgent candidacy revealed a deep level of national frustration with politics as usual even among democrats who have controlled the white house since 2009 clinton outpaced sanders in winning new superdelegate endorsements even after his string of primary and caucus wins in may following the results in puerto rico it is no longer possible for sanders to reach the 2 383 needed to win the nomination based on the remaining available pledged delegates and uncommitted superdelegates according to the ap clinton leads sanders by more than 3 million cast votes by 291 pledged delegates and by 523 superdelegates she also won 29 caucuses and primaries compared to his 21 victories echoing the sentiments of california gov jerry brown who overcame a decades long rivalry with the clinton family to endorse her last week many superdelegates expressed a desire to close ranks around a nominee who could not defeat trump in november beyond winning over millions of sanders supporters who vow to remain loyal to the self described democratic socialist clinton faces challenges as she turns toward november including criticism of her decision to use a private email server run from her new york home while serving as secretary of state her deep unpopularity among republicans has pushed many leery of trump to nevertheless embrace his campaign this to me is about saving the country and preventing a third progressive liberal term which is what a clinton presidency would do house speaker paul ryan told the ap last week after he finally endorsed trump weeks after the new yorker clinched the republican party nomination yet clinton showed no signs of limping into the general election as she approached the milestone leaving sanders behind and focusing on lacerating trump she said electing the billionaire businessman who has spent months hitting her and her husband with bitingly personal attacks would be a historic mistake he is not just unprepared he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge stability and immense responsibility clinton said last week in a speech that was striking in its forcefulness previewing a brutal five month general election campaign to come even without the nomination sanders can claim ideological victory his liberal positions pushed the issue of income inequality into the spotlight and drove clinton to the left on issues such as trade wall street and campaign finance reform but she prevailed in part by claiming much of the coalition that boosted obama she won overwhelming support from women and minorities catapulting her to decisive victories in diverse delegate rich states such as new york and texas when clinton launched her campaign last april she did so largely unopposed having scared off more formidable challengers by locking down much of the partys organizational and fundraising infrastructure vice president joe biden seen as her most threatening rival opted not to run in october of the four opponents who did take her on sanders was the only one who emerged to provide a serious challenge he caught fire among young voters and independents his campaign gaining momentum from a narrow loss in iowa in february and a commanding victory in new hampshire his ability to raise vast sums of money online gave him the resources to continue into the spring but clinton vowed not to repeat the failings of her 2008 campaign and focused early on winning delegates hiring help from obamas old team before launching her campaign they pushed superdelegates into making early commitments and held campaign appearances in areas where they could not win the most pledged delegates her victory in nevada in late february diminished concerns from allies about her campaign operation decisive wins in southern states on super tuesday and a sweep of march 15 contests gave her a significant delegate lead which became insurmountable by the end of april after big victories in new york and in the northeast she now moves on to face trump whose ascent to the top of the republican party few expected the brash real estate mogul and reality tv star has long since turned his attention from primary foes to clinton debuting a nickname crooked hillary and arguing she belongs in jail for her email setup after a long primary campaign clinton said this past weekend in california she was ready to accept his challenge we are judged by our words and our deeds not our race not our ethnicity not our religion she said saturday in oxnard so it is time to judge donald trump by his words and his deeds and i believe that his words and his deeds disqualify him from being president of the united states the associated press contributed to this report.,REAL

at stake tuesday and forcing florida sen marco rubio out of the race by handing him a humiliating defeat in his home state but mr trump failed to sweep losing in ohio to the states governor john kasich it was governor kasichs first win of primary season giving him cause to stay in the race even as he was mathematically eliminated from contention kasichs only hope is for a contested national convention in july where he somehow emerges as a “unity candidate for now though trump dominates in the delegate race with 621 of the 1 237 needed to secure the nomination as of early wednesday texas sen ted cruz sits in second place with 396 to reach the magic number of 1 237 before the republican convention in cleveland trump would need to win some 58 percent of the remaining delegates a tough task in a three person race but not impossible “a contested convention remains a 50 50 proposition but should trump fall just shy of the magic number the republican party will be contesting him at its own peril says republican strategist ford o connell tuesdays results revealed and reinforced several points about the strength of both trump and clinton for trump tuesdays victories came in spite of the front runners unwillingness to condemn acts of violence by supporters at his rallies which party leaders have urged him to do last weekend trump canceled a rally in chicago after anti trump protesters infiltrated the venue and threatened to shut it down leading to skirmishes between pro and anti trump activists trump went on to win the illinois primary tuesday by 9 points beating senator cruz 39 percent to 30 percent trump supporters are known to back him early and not budge from their position and on tuesday exit polls showed continued popularity for his views some 52 percent of voters said they wanted an “outsider for president and of those trump won 69 percent of the vote trump also won the majority of voters who want to deport undocumented immigrants are “angry at the federal government favor a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states and are falling behind financially he also won 47 percent of voters who oppose free trade “all are impressive results in a multi candidate race writes pollster gary langer in an analysis for abc news in remarks tuesday night to reporters and invited guests at his mar a lago estate in palm beach fla trump highlighted the millions of dollars of negative ads that his primary opponents and outside groups funded by the republican “establishment have run against him to seemingly little effect still trump remains a deeply divisive figure in the republican party as tuesdays exit polls showed “among republicans who did not vote for him this tuesday night 61 percent said they d seriously consider a third party candidate if it were trump versus clinton in november mr langer notes “indeed in another question 45 percent of non trump supporters flatly said they would not vote for him in november if he were the partys nominee the prospect of trump causing a formal split in the republican party seems as real as ever if he goes into the convention with a majority of delegates or close to a majority but party regulars are at a loss over how to resolve the issue advisers to trump and cruz categorically rule out the idea of even allowing kasich to compete in a contested convention according to politico “if trump has hundreds more delegates than the runner up (almost certainly cruz) and he is over 1 000 delegates it will be exceedingly difficult to deny him the nomination write analysts at sabatos crystal ball “in fact to do so would be to guarantee a meltdown of historic proportions in cleveland in tuesdays democratic contests former secretary of state clinton beat senator sanders handily in florida ohio and north carolina beat him narrowly in her native state of illinois and fought him to a virtual tie in missouri most important she recovered her balance after losing to the vermonter the week before in a stunning upset in michigan sanders had hoped to continue his rust belt incursion with victories in illinois ohio and missouri with his message of economic populism and opposition to free trade but he failed clinton won big among racial and ethnic minorities as usual but in ohio also won big among white voters a cohort she had lost in michigan among white women in ohio she won 61 percent to 39 percent langer notes “clinton found her footing in ohio on issues as well to some extent defanging sanders on free trade she won antitrade voters a group sanders took in michigan langer writes “as many saw him as too anti business as saw her as too pro business and four in 10 called his policies unrealistic twice as many as said so about hers in her victory speech tuesday evening clinton pivoted toward a general election message that echoed both sanders and trump repeatedly promising creation of “good jobs “good paying jobs are the tickets to the middle class and we are going to stand up for the american middle class again clinton said “we are going to stand up for american workers and make sure no one takes advantage of us not china not wall street and not overpaid corporate executives still despite a big deficit in pledged delegates sanders is certain to take his fight for the democratic nomination all the way to the partys convention in philadelphia in july he is still

this isn t what the republican party wanted when it began sanctioning and limiting debates following the 2012 presidential election and it certainly didn t expect a blow up like this with fox news of all the networks the republican national committee wanted to control the message and protect its candidates (and brand) but that hasn t worked out so well trump as it turns out has been a bigger force and commands a louder megaphone than anyone else in the party just how much will he use it thursday night at his veterans event? 2 who exactly will trumps event benefit and how much will be raised? charity events like this aren t exactly things that can be slapped together in 24 to 48 hours very efficiently what will the energy be like? and who exactly will the money be going to? trump has said maybe it should go to wounded warriors (the wounded warrior project the subject of controversy over its spending habits) but the press release just said a special event to benefit veterans organizations 3 what about the debate how much will trump come up? trump won t even be at the debate but hes already the dominant topic there are two sides to this the moderators and the candidates you d have to guess the moderators would have to say something about trumps absence (and no there won t be an empty lectern rnc spokesman sean spicer said on cnn wednesday) and certainly a few candidates would like a free shot at trump especially his closest rival ted cruz the texas senator even challenged trump to a debate at a college in western iowa on saturday evening and you know what they say about candidates who are asking for debates (hint it comes as cruzs poll numbers are slipping in the hawkeye state) 4 who grabs the spotlight instead? there are still lots of storylines to play out at this debate cruz will now be in the center of the stage and that means he might be the one everyone winds up going after in earlier debates cruz held back in the last debate he showed why he was a champion college debater but whos his foil without trump on the stage? others need to break through too florida sen marco rubio has quietly remained in third in iowa and in the top three in new hampshire but his path is still hard to see rubio has had plenty of differences on these stages with other candidates (cruz new jersey gov chris christie and former florida gov jeb bush for example) can he show why democrats seem to fear a rubio nomination more than any other candidate? this has been an election dominated by the outsiders thanks to more hard line conservatives fed up with the system in years past the party has gotten that out of its system in iowa and establishment picks have eventually emerged this year is pointing in a different direction but there are still others trying to be viable in that establishment lane ohio gov john kasich is the latest to have some momentum in new hampshire this debate may be in iowa but it is being broadcast to a national audience and you can bet kasichs target will be some 1 300 miles east on caucus night he ll already be in the granite state not iowa bush has been on his last legs for a while but he was more relaxed in the last debate he has certainly taken on trump and he ll likely do so again even if trumps not on the stage christie had a solid performance in his last debate he ll probably mix it up again 6 is trump really the teflon don of this race? there is some risk for trump in not going to the debate he can look presumptuous entitled and untouchable maybe he really is the teflon don of this race it is certainly not what a typical front runner would do that candidate would play it safe have a good debate and position himself to win the first two contests but thats not trumps style he doesn t just play it big he plays it huge and thats what hes doing again so will iowans feel snubbed? or more precisely will iowans who have been supporting him to big numbers suddenly start to peel off? thats pretty unlikely he can argue hes not snubbing iowa; hes snubbing fox which in and of itself is pretty remarkable considering the role fox plays in republican politics and conservative circles some candidate might figure out a way to use trumps absence as an opportunity but the likelihood again is trump will spin this into a win as the other candidates are forced to participate in a game without the star player whom everyone came to see.,REAL

3976,prague (reuters) czech ano party leader andrej babis said on tuesday he expected his minority cabinet to take power on dec 13 which would enable him to attend a european union summit as prime minister after meeting president milos zeman babis said he had not yet secured backing for his cabinet in the lower house of parliament where ano has 78 out of 200 seats and other parties have so far rejected joining or backing babiss administration lacking any direct left right ideology babis won the october election on pledges to cut corruption among mainstream parties fight immigration and make government more efficient and pro business i convinced mr president for an earlier date for appointing the cabinet on dec13 because on dec 14 and 15 the european council will take place which will obviously be very important babis told reporters the progress of negotiations with great britain over its departure from the eu will be the main topic of the summit babis said zeman would appoint him on dec 6 as prime minister and his full cabinet on dec 13 from which date the new team will take power regardless whether it has parliamentary majority the main sticking point for babis a businessman ranked by forbes as the second richest czech worth 4 dollars billion is that police want parliament to lift his immunity so he can be charged with illegal tapping of an eu subsidy a decade ago he denies any wrongdoing but the case has made him toxic for most of the other eight parliamentary factions a parliamentary vote on his immunity is expected in the coming weeks lack of mainstream partners has raised the prospect babis may negotiate support with the anti nato pro russian communist party and the far right freedom and direct democracy party (spd) which wants to quit the eu nato and fight what it calls eu forced islamisation babis has repeatedly said he is ready to clash with eu partners over migration but also praised the eus role as guarantor of peaceful europe and said he was a pro european politician if the government loses a confidence vote prescribed within a month of its appointment it must resign but it will stay in office until another solution is found which can take months.,REAL

423,it is 2016 (finally)! iowa voters will head to their caucuses in four weeks the country will pick a new president in about 10 months it is all happening people given all of that it is time to revisit my rankings of the candidates who could not be the republican presidential nominee it is a shrinking list but still far longer than that of the democrats side where it is hillary clintons race to lose (still) the candidate ranked no 1 below is the most likely as of now to be the republican party nominee and for the record i think it is possible (if not probable) that we go into cleveland for the republican national convention in july with no candidate with enough delegates to be the nominee 1 ted cruz the senator from texas has been underestimated and underrated at every step of the primary process no longer cruz is solidly in first place in iowa and barring some sort of unforeseen collapse will win the first in the nation caucuses he also should run well in south carolina on feb 20 and in the “sec primary on march 1 cruz thanks to donald trump is now being seen in some republican party circles as a conservative non disastrous alternative to the real estate mogul and unlike other conservative insurgents of the past cruz has the money in his campaign committee and in a constellation of super pacs backing him to last for the duration of the race 2 marco rubio he has emerged as the establishment favorite a designation made apparent by the number of major dollar donors who jumped off the fence to be on his side over the past few months the problem for rubio is that he doesn t have an obvious win among the first few states to vote iowa looks to be a lost cause although maybe finishing first in the “establishment primary might be enough? and new hampshire is a place where everybody is looking up at trump south carolina may be rubios shot much of the senior command of his campaign is made up of palmetto state operatives but thats not a given the nevada caucuses where rubio is a favorite are feb 23; can he wait until the fourth vote to get a win? 3 trump the most likely scenario is that he finishes second behind cruz in iowa and wins new hampshire where does that leave him? who knows polling puts him ahead by double digits in south carolina but that states voters undoubtedly will be affected by what iowa and new hampshire do and what does losing iowa mean if anything for trumps psyche or how he is viewed by supporters? does he get angry redouble his efforts and actually start spending his own money? or does he throw up his hands and walk away? i think the former is the more likely option trump loves what he has done in this campaign and has little to no interest in giving it up anytime soon 4 chris christie the new jersey governor has fought his way back to credibility largely thanks to his intense focus on new hampshire where he has lavished attention over the past year christie spent a few days last week in iowa evidence that his campaign thinks he could not sneak out a surprising showing (and crucial momentum) from the relatively open field behind cruz and trump in the state christies greatest asset is himself he is a talented retail campaigner which plays well in iowa and new hampshire what remains to be seen is whether christie can weather an attack on his administrations politically motivated george washington bridge lane closures that ad is coming from some opponent if christie starts to look like a real threat to win new hampshire 5 jeb bush how does bush make this list after a 2015 that saw him go from front runner to also ran in the polls? simple money his right to rise super pac remains well funded and is spending millions going after his opponents in iowa and new hampshire my guess is that it won t be enough or close to enough to save bush from his biggest problem in this race he just isn t an energetic or frankly good candidate voters think they know what they are getting with jeb and they don t want it 6 john kasich the ohio governor needs a moment in new hampshire badly after an early burst in the granite state and nationally kasich has essentially disappeared polling still puts him within striking range in new hampshire but it is not clear that kasich will have the money or the message to drive the sort of push he clearly needs and even if he survives to fight another day post new hampshire the calendar larded with southern states looks to be decidedly inhospitable to him 7 carsohuckorum ben carson mike huckabee and rick santorum are all candidates of and for the social conservative movement which is a dominant force in the iowa caucuses and to a slightly lesser extent the south carolina primary all three therefore have a punchers chance of surprising people (as huckabee did in 2008 and santorum did in 2012) with a stronger than expected showing in iowa if i had to pick which of the three would be most likely to score that sort of breakthrough i d pick huckabee solely because of his candidate skills.,REAL

2954,new york (reuters) washington states attorney general has promised to uncover “what truly motivated president donald trumps executive order on immigration an approach that could not prompt a rare public examination of how a us president makes national security decisions the presidential order imposed a temporary ban on travelers from seven predominantly muslim countries but a federal judge has barred enforcement of the order while the court considers a challenge brought by washington state on thursday the us court of appeals for the 9th circuit left the judges ruling in place without deciding the ultimate merits of either sides arguments in its decision the 9th circuit cited a previous case establishing that “circumstantial evidence of intent including … statements by decisionmakers may be considered in evaluating whether a governmental action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose the trump administration has argued that the ban is necessary to prevent potential terrorists from entering the country and is not discriminatory because the text of the order does not mention any particular religion washington attorney general bob ferguson signaled on sunday that he will move aggressively to obtain written documents and emails authored by administration officials that might contain evidence the order was unconstitutionally biased against muslims or islam he also said he would also move to depose administration officials legal scholars say this could not move the court into uncharted waters “the idea of looking at motive has never really been applied to the president said john yoo a former justice department lawyer in the george w bush administration “it would represent a serious expansion of judicial oversight of what the president and the entire executive branch does said yoo now a professor at the university of california at berkeley school of law trump has harshly criticized the federal judge in washington for his decision and a top white house aide on sunday accused the 9th circuit of a “judicial usurpation of power “the presidents powers here are beyond question senior policy adviser stephen miller told fox news sunday us courts have historically been careful about probing the motives behind laws in part out of respect for the separation of powers between branches of government but on questions of racial or religious discrimination they have sometimes allowed intent to be examined in 1993 for instance the supreme court found that an ordinance banning animal sacrifice in hialeah florida though neutral on its face was actually intended to discriminate against a santeria church which holds sacrifice as a sacred rite stephen griffin a professor of constitutional law at tulane university said cases like this make it clear that the court can look beyond the words of trumps executive order “motive is relevant he said one question in the current case is likely to be which if any of trumps statements should be admissible in examining the administrations motives in issuing the order “if you re allowed to use evidence from the campaign the states case is very strong said griffin in december 2015 days after a mass attack by an islamic state sympathizers in san bernardino california trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our representatives can figure out what is going on he later said he supported only suspending immigration from areas with a history of terrorism stanford university law school professor michael mcconnell a former federal appeals judge said the court should not consider campaign statements because trump only swore an oath to uphold the constitution after he became president in its complaint washington cited an interview the president did on the day the order was signed with the christian broadcasting network saying he would prioritize christians in the middle east for admission as refugees legal experts are divided on whether the states lawyers should be allowed to question the presidents advisers and possibly even the president in depositions the white house could not potentially claim executive privilege which protects the president and other officials from subpoena said thomas lee an expert in constitutional law at fordham university anna rose mathieson a partner with the california appellate law group said that one person who might be more easily deposed would be presidential adviser and former new york city mayor rudolph giuliani who told fox news the president had asked him to put a commission together to figure out how to make a muslim ban legal david pressman a partner at boies schiller flexner and former assistant secretary of homeland security in the obama administration said there are important protections in place so that the executive branch can receive national security advice “you don t want a situation in which courts are adjudicating intelligence that is coming to the executive when trying to formulate policy said pressman though in this case pressman said he did not believe the national security argument for the order was clear opening the door to further questioning the next steps in the case are not certain the trump administration has said it is considering appealing the 9th circuit ruling to the supreme court and the 9th circuit itself might decide to rehear the case with a larger panel of judges the president has also said he might replace the order with “a brand new one which could not end the current legal action.,REAL

1641,on august 9 2004 just three weeks before the republican national convention was set to convene at madison square garden and renominate president george w bush new york magazine had a modest proposal for its namesake city secession from the united states “in a country that grows ever redder it is the bluest of blue cities in one of the bluest of blue states with the eccentrics to match jennifer senior wrote “psychically then new york already seems headed out of the union so why not go all the way? for much of late twentieth century people in the heartland felt the same way about new york it was the city of taxi drivers travis bickle a near bankruptcy in 1975 son of sam bernie goetz the central park five looting wilding crack squeegee men 2 000 homicides a year the city senior wrote in 2004 “has always felt like a nation apart for decades what we are witnessing in 2016 would have been unthinkable two new yorkers running head to head for president of the united states hillary clinton a former new york senator who lives in chappaqua and based her campaign in hipster brooklyn is competing against a fast talking real estate mogul from queens whose life is almost a parody of new york glitz and excess twenty years ago ted cruzs attempt to take down donald trump with a knock on “new york values might have played well in the heartland but this year it felt like an out of touch attempt to play to someones aging uncle what happened? in many ways america has changed becoming more urban and polyglot; in that sense new york now resembles the rest of the nation more than it used to but something far more important happened as well exactly 15 years ago when the planes hit the twin towers on september 11 2001 and as the nation grieved the thousands dead in lower manhattan new york city underwent a transformation both on the ground and in american eyes it was no longer the freewheeling vaguely foreign island that conservatives had vilified for decades it was the symbol of america that enemies had chosen to attack in its response it became the home of american heroism and resilience of first responders and men and women caked in dust and ash this is one of the underappreciated changes wrought by the tragedy on that moment 15 years ago new york city became part of america again and it paved the way for a future that nobody would have imagined in which new yorkers weren t just competing in national politics but would win the white house regardless of which major political party proves victorious in november since he descended the escalator at trump tower in manhattan to announce he was running for president donald trump has embraced his new york roots queens the borough where he was raised has stayed with him the macho swagger the aggression the tabloid newspaper sensibilities the lunch pail conservatism and as hes barnstormed across the nation he has stayed firmly identified with new york whenever possible he even leaves the campaign trail to fly back to new york so he can sleep at home in his penthouse overlooking central park rather than staying overnight in some iowa fleabag as flashy as the neon facades in times square trump wears his association with new york city with pride and has for quite some time on the debut episode of the apprentice in 2004 he waxed poetic about the city borrowing some of its sheen for his comeback attempt “new york he said in a voiceover “my city where the wheels of the global economy never stop turning a concrete metropolis of unparalleled strength and purpose that drives the business world manhattan is a tough place this island is the real jungle he hawks the city as if he wants to adopt every stereotype about new yorkers out there casting himself as the citys personification similarly hillary clinton a new yorker by choice not by birth has made little effort to play down her own new york connections she still lives in chappaqua a tony manhattan suburb and summers in the hamptons rubbing shoulders with wall street financiers trust funders and celebrities her campaign is based out of brooklyn her husband former president bill clinton keeps a fully staffed office in harlem her daughter chelsea lives in a block long condo in the flatiron district it wasn t always like this in 1940 another republican presidential nominee understood that being from manhattan could not be a liability on the campaign trail wendell willkie was the wealthy president of a large electric company based in new york and lived in a lavish mansion on fifth avenue years earlier he had begun a very public affair with a renowned new york book editor until 1939 the year before he announced he would run for president he was a registered democrat the parallels to donald trump another businessman from new york and former registered democrat whose marital infidelities were splashed across page six in the 1990s are obvious and unmistakable both willkie and trump have lived out the traits that those in the heartland long associated with manhattan loose morals liberal values and ostentatious wealth but whereas trump has doubled down on his new york identity wendell willkie made a different play in 1940 toning down his new york lifestyle to compete in national politics according to bruce dearstyne author of the spirit of new york defining events in the empire states history willkie refashioned himself as a humble midwesterner traveling to his childhood home in rushville indiana to accept the republican nomination the makeover was of little use his attempt to transform himself from glitzy new york tycoon to grass roots indianan fell flat alice roosevelt longworth herself the daughter of a president and wife of a speaker of the house quipped that willkie came “from the grass roots of 10 000 country clubs after willkie lost to fdr in 1940 the republicans nominated another moderate new yorker thomas dewey in the presidential races of 1944 and 1948 twice more they lost the national election an aversion for new york city that place so out of touch with the conservative morals of the republican party base would eventually become enshrined in the republican playbook “we could not tell new york to kiss our ass and we could not really start a conservative party said arizona senator barry goldwater in 1960 four years later he would beat out nelson rockefeller a mainline conservative from new york city who proudly called himself a “liberal republican for the republican party presidential nomination republicans increasingly took to framing american politics as a struggle that pitted conservatives in the heartland against liberal urban elites who believed in gun control abortion rights for gays and the separation of church and state “their aim thomas frank wrote in his 2004 book whats the matter with kansas “was simply to bolster the stereotypes using whatever tools were at hand to cast the democrats as the party of a wealthy pampered arrogant elite that lives as far as it can from real americans; and to represent republicanism as the faith of the hardworking common people of the heartland an expression of their unpretentious all american ways just like country music and nascar new york was bound up in this vilified as a symbol for liberal values “historically americans from the heartland have always had this paradoxical relationship with new york city said andrew hartman the author of a war for the soul of america in an interview with politico magazine “it is the quintessential american city but for religious conservatives it is all thats wrong with the united states american culture in terms of its cosmopolitanism its secularism through the 1970s 80s and 90s national politicians in both parties studiously cultivated a downhome rural patina blue blooded george hw bush a connecticut senators son who graduated from yale and lived for a time in the lavish apartment in the waldorf astoria hotel reserved for the american ambassador to the united nations recast himself as a texan and doubled down on cultural traditionalism and while bill clinton was running for president in 1992 his campaign routed a bus tour through as many back roads and small towns in the south as possible showcasing the candidate in rural america away from cosmopolitan cities like new york though he was officially nominated at the democratic convention at madison square garden in 1992 the metropolis wasn t always kind to him clinton would have several major confrontations with hecklers and protesters that year including several widely televised encounters with aids activists new york so far to the left that it clashed with the democratic nominee during the 1990s the era of clinton and giuliani new york lost some of the grittier aspects that had long made it distasteful to the rest of the country the streets were cleaned up crime rates fell in the economic boom during president bill clintons second term new york was prospering it was territory so friendly that first lady hillary clinton chose to adopt new york citizenship and run for an open us senate seat in 2000 the de facto readmission of new york into the union happened when the planes hit the twin towers of the world trade center on september 11 2001 “there was a lot of sympathy for new york city admiration for new york city says dearstyne “people realized it was special new york could not no longer be treated like the plague; indeed it was impossible to criticize or seem hostile toward it suddenly politicians on both sides of the aisle were incorporating haunting images of the rubble outside the world trade center into their campaign ads in one spot from 2002 senator max cleland of georgia read a poem praising the city in another ad two years later the bush campaign showed five firefighters lugging a stretcher draped in an american flag the ad was controversial democrats claimed the bush campaign was using september 11 for political gain but it and others like it aired in 17 battleground states across the country a daily reminder in the years after the september 11 attacks that new yorkers had acted bravely that year the republicans even held their convention in manhattans madison square garden the first time the city had hosted an rnc since the party was founded 150 years earlier “september 11 tilted the view away from this longstanding late twentieth century trope about new york city being the hotbed of the devil and all the things that are wrong with the country hartman says at the same time the 9/11 attacks happened as longer shifts in the political landscape were manifesting changes that made it easier for new york based candidates to compete on a national level americans were increasingly moving to and living in cities meanwhile internet access and mass media chipped away at regional divisions making the distinction between urban and rural america less contentious “american political divisions have become much more nationalized says dan hopkins a political science professor at the university of pennsylvania “it is less important where a candidate is from instead people care about what party they are from meanwhile public opinion shifted to the left on issues like gay marriage and gun control pulling mainstream opinion more in line with new york socially and making it harder for conservatives to suggest that manhattan was at war with the american heartland thats not to say that after september 11 social conservatives abandoned their habit of cordoning new york off from the heartland altogether (“have you ever tried to order grits in a fancy manhattan restaurant? good luck mike huckabee wrote in his 2015 book god guns grits and gravy “to borrow a phrase from the once senator and presidential candidate … there really are two americas) and indeed several new york politicians have tried to mount presidential campaigns since september 11 and failed rudy giuliani for example never quite connected with voters in the american heartland in his 2008 bid to earn the republican party nomination but whats important is that his being from new york was no longer debilitating; it no longer disqualified him right off the bat september 11 has aided trump more palpably when ted cruz accused him of having “new york values during a presidential debate hosted by the fox business channel in january trump parried deftly neutralizing the question in one fell swoop “when the world trade center came down i saw something that no place on earth could not have handled more beautifully more humanely than new york you had two 110 story buildings come crashing down thousands of people killed and the cleanup started the next day and it was the most horrific cleanup probably in the history of doing this … i was down there and i ve never seen anything like it and the people in new york fought and fought and fought … we rebuilt downtown manhattan and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved new york and loved new yorkers and i have to tell you that was a very insulting statement that ted made fifteen years ago before september 11 a presidential candidate would have had to answer the awkward question cruz was trying to plant head on if you grew up in new york city in a life of luxury and comfort going into bankruptcy four times how can you understand the concerns of average americans? before september 11 would trump have been able to deliver an answer satisfying enough to win over 40 percent of the republican electorate? maybe but back then it would ve been a whole lot harder clinton has tried to do employ the same argument that trump used to swat away an opponents criticisms asked about her wall street contributors at a november 2015 debate in iowa she pivoted “where were we attacked? we were attacked in downtown manhattan where wall street is i did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild that was good for new york it was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country her pivot was awkward even tacky some said but the fact remained september 11 helped neutralize concerns about her ties to new york now with less than two months left in the presidential race new york continues to play an outsized role in the election both campaigns are based out of the city former mayor rudy giuliani is among trumps most active surrogates while his successor michael bloomberg has endorsed clinton and is making a major play in senate and house races throughout the country come the morning of november 9 a new yorker will likely be the president elect of the united states as for the secession talk? thats disappeared altogether perhaps because the city now feels like it is now more a part of the rest of the country than it was 20 years ago still that 2004 new york magazine piece proved oddly prescient even if its forecast was a bit off after seceding

norway with its oil generated trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund is one of the worlds richest countries and hardly beset by integration issues this she says is because they versus been careful many of the jobs here today perhaps will not be here tomorrow working in supermarkets for example those kinds of jobs that don t need higher education those who come to norway without any education what are they going to do in the future if this continues? the case for limiting economic migration is clear but about half of the registered asylum seekers in the eu last year were from countries that were struck by conflict can norway justify taking so few? ms listhaug is a practicing christian (albeit skeptical of the thoroughly socialist church of norway) and says her governments immigration policy when combined with its aid policy is not just a moral response but the most effective moral response for me it is a moral issue as well you can t just help the ones you see you have to think about the millions you don t see and that have a very difficult life in the world shes referring to the refugee camps in jordan where both norway and the uk senator aid to help those displaced by war norway gave 23 million to its jordanian mission last year almost twice as much per capita as britain the cost of helping refugees at home is taken from its foreign aid budget so as its influx subsides and costs fall all savings are used to help refugees abroad some 370 million has been transferred so far with more expected next yearso to ms listhaug it is not a question of whether to help refugees but how best to do so we meet after she visited brandon lewis her british counterpart who gave her a striking statistic the immigration minister here in britain said that for the price of helping 3 000 young people here he could not help 100 000 children in other parts of the world she sees this as a modern way to help asylum seekers and more practical than the 1951 un refugee convention which obliges signatories to accommodate anyone with a well founded fear of persecution it was an agreement for its time she says but when people travel through 20 countries to come to a safe haven i think people can see that this is not right you could not have a safe haven in your neighboring country so why go so far? western countries that define their virtue by the number of refugees they let in she says also face a moral question why should we have a system that works for the people who have money [to pay for the journey] while the rest of the refugees and people in need don t have the money to go? people traffickers she says thrive on governments that follow the old rules and accept those who turn up on their shores if you smuggle an unaccompanied minor from afghanistan to europe they say it is between 3000 dollars and 20000 dollars young girls she says are sometimes sold to old men to finance such a journey also children are killed or raped on their way so we need to have this under control ms listhaug provoked fury in sweden a few weeks ago by visiting a suburb in stockholm notorious for unrest among its young immigrant population she called it a no go zone a phrase that the swedes angrily reject but she doesn t seem to mind causing a fuss especially as she thinks her critics are coming around to her way of thinking nor does she mind using sweden as a case study in what not to do a lot of countries in europe are thinking more like us like denmark and austria germany as well france has big problems right now with integration as does belgium a lot of countries in europe see that we need to have this under control the norwegian model she says is very different and very clear if you are an economic migrant you are declined in norway she says we senator people back to afghanistan if they are not in need of protection; we senator them back to somalia if they are not in need of protection isn t this a rather expensive process? yes but it is well worth it police are also senator out to areas where illegal immigrants are suspected of living and working if we find them we senator them out that has also decreased crime in norway thats very good i ask listhaug if she is getting used to being called cruel and heartless how does it make her feel? her response comes quickly i don t give a damn she says she thinks her approach is right and the consensus is wrong and as she says an increasing number of other countries think the same a new consensus might well be in the making spectatorukso what do her neighbors in sweden think of her tough positions on asylum seekers? the swedish resident in the video below has nothing but praise for listhaug he openly praises her while mocking the lefties who have allowed out of control migration to destroy much of sweden in the video below he reminds swedes of the startling crime statistics they are facing in sweden we have 10 times more car torchings do you want this?

2133,name one time this reckless commander in chief has put our men and women in uniform before the war on terror just oneon monday the obama administration announced that president obama would veto a defense authorization bill if it did not close down guantanamo bay white house press secretary josh earnest explained that the house funding bill would be vetoed principally because of the irresponsible way that it funds our national defense priorities but also because of the efforts to prevent the closure [of] the prison at guantanamo bay he added that democrats would sustain obamas veto and defense authorization would dieobamas strong stand on gitmo underscores two vital points first president obama does not fear defunding americas national security second obama does not fear republicans in congressthe national defense authorization act (ndaa) has been authorized for five decades running the current ndaa fully funds the military through a workaround measure thanks to president obamas demands that a huge chunk of sequestration cuts come from defense funding now democrats complain that the workaround measure isn t good enough republicans should bust open the bank againbut thats not obamas main criticism of the ndaa he has long had a bug in his ear with regard to gitmo which he feels has strengthened terrorists feelings about the evils of the united states given his recent moves to parlay with the cuban dictatorship as well obama may want to hand gitmo in totality back to the cuban government the fact that obama would be willing to dramatically cut americas military funding even as russia takes over ukraine and syria as iran gears up for a big regional military push as china continues its aggressive behavior in the south china sea demonstrates obamas top priority is doing leftist work not protecting the united statesin fact obamas choice to prioritize gitmo above national security isn t a choice at all obama wants americas military slashed and he wants gitmo closed senator sen john mccain (r az) agrees with obama that gitmo should be closed but even he says that obama has manipulated the process to create an impasse according to roll call mccain has said the white house promised him a plan to close the prison but has yet to present one without that he has said he wouldn t be able to find the votes to do what the white house wants now normally obamas nasty priorities would pose little threat to military funding after all obama would be stymied by republicans in congress and obama has threatened to veto the ndaa before over guantanamo; each time congress has called obamas bluff and he has signed the bill into lawbut this time the feeling is that obama could not be more serious after all with the legacy of republicans folding on executive amnesty the iran deal and funding for planned parenthood among others obama probably feels he can leverage gitmo out of existence he believes that republicans fear defense defunding more than he must their constituents will hold them accountable while hes in pure f*** it list mode he also thinks that republicans are unwilling to undergo a head to head matchup with him under almost any circumstancesand obama is right in his entire tenure as commander in chief obama has had to issue a grand total of four vetoes four thats less than every president since chester a arthur who filled out james garfields term serving less than four years obama has had a fully republican congress this year and a republican house since 2010 he has issued just two vetoes this year one with regard to keystone xl pipeline and the other with regard to a bill related to the national labor relations board all of his other major policy priorities have been guarded zealously by a democratic minority or an unwilling republican majorityso why wouldn t obama try to hold republicans feet to the fire on defense authorization?obamas mastery of congress is unprecedented in american history; the only other candidates for that title either held congressional dominance within their own party (franklin delano roosevelt) or ruled a congressional rump (abraham lincoln) shutting down americas defense funding would be a crowning achievement for a president who cares more about weakening americas role in the world than defending her citizensvia breitbart news.,FAKE

314,hillary clinton and bernie sanders are in a pitched battle for the democratic nomination fighting for the hearts and minds of left leaning voters across the us but where do they stand on the issues? while the candidates often agree on substance if not style heres a look at five areas where they differ not just from each other but from their presidential predecessors as well they will go up but for whom? bernie sanders promises he will reduce income inequality through changes to us through tax policy he has called for a 10% tax surcharge on billionaires raising the top three tax brackets and creating a new top rate boosting capital gains and estate taxes extending social security taxes going after income made abroad by us corporations and creating a new 02% tax on all earners to fund a paid family leave programme hillary clintons tax plan is basically sanders lite she wants a 4% surtax on income over 5 dollars million an increase in capital gains taxes the closing of tax loopholes for the wealthy taxing hedge fund managers carried interest income at higher rates and increasing the estate tax rate bill clinton also raised taxes on the wealthy and caught considerable criticism from conservatives for doing so he instituted two new high level tax brackets raised corporate taxes and increased income subject to medicare and social security levies after republicans took control of congress two years into his administration he signed legislation lowering the capital gains taxes he also increased a tax credit for poorer workers john f kennedy was the original democratic tax cutter he reduced the top rate in the us from 95% to 65% and the corporate tax rate from 52% to 47% todays conservatives love to quote his claim that a high tax rate siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power pitching college education thats free or just affordable bernie sanders has set the bar when it comes to higher education policy in the modern democratic party with his call for free college for all americans funded by taxing wall street financial transactions he points to the runaway costs of higher education as one of the driving forces behind growing income inequality in the us hillary clinton supports a plan to make two year community college free but her higher education policies are more modest she has called for lowering student loan interest rates providing 175 dollars billion to improve the quality of higher education and encouraging colleges to set affordable tuition rates that don t require student loans barack obama signed legislation streamlining the student loan system including provisions that allow the government to directly loan money to students rather than rely on for profit middle men he has also proposed making the first two years of college free with a programme modelled on a tennessee system devised by the states republican governor lyndon baines johnson is the godfather of the modern democratic partys education policies as president he spearheaded passage of the higher education act of 1965 which increased federal funding for universities and provided low interest student loans and grants for needy students it was landmark legislation in its day but now seems relatively modest mend it or end it and start over from scratch barack obama supported and signed legislation increasing government regulation of the health insurance industry and creating private insurance markets for individuals not covered by employer provided insurance the programme was based in part on republican proposals from the 1990s and the system instituted in massachusetts by then governor mitt romney for bernie sanders however that particular half loaf is far from enough he wants to institute a single payer government run health insurance system fashioned on medicare he has also called for allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies in order to lower prices and permitting americans to import medication from canada where it is less expensive hillary clinton has said mr sanders is advancing an unrealistic proposal that threatens hard won healthcare reforms made during mr obamas tenure instead she wants to expand existing law to improve coverage for prescription drugs and allow the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers for better prices the former first lady does know a thing or two about how hard it is to get healthcare bills through congress in 1993 she was the driving force behind bill clintons proposed legislation which created a federal minimum benefits healthcare package with limits on out of pocket expenses all provided by regional healthcare alliances that effort went down in flames before it even came to a vote in congress the one place where clinton comes at sanders from the left hillary clinton is the first prominent democratic presidential candidate to openly run on a gun control platform since al gores losing campaign in 2000 she supports holding gun manufacturers liable for deaths caused by their products expanding background checks and prohibiting those on no fly list from purchasing firearms she has also supported reinstating the ban on semi automatic assault rifles bernie sanders a senator from the rural state of vermont has a more moderate position on guns although he has moved to the left over the course of the campaign he supports expanded background checks on gun purchases and an assault weapons ban but opposes holding gun manufacturers liable for deaths he voted against a gun purchase waiting period multiple times in the early 1990s and for allowing guns in national parks barack obama shied away from campaigning on gun control in his two presidential campaigns but the murder of schoolchildren in newtown connecticut in december 2012 convinced him to act he has since called for an assault weapons ban and expanded background checks he has taken unilateral executive action to increase enforcement of laws against gun trafficking and broadening the scope of federal regulation of firearm transactions franklin delano roosevelt made the first serious effort at gun control by a democratic president to date and his call in 1934 to create a national firearm registry and institute a federal tax on all gun purchases no major democratic officeholder would even consider broaching such a proposal today it wouldn t just be dead on arrival in congress for many politicians it would be political suicide hillary clinton as secretary of state was one of the more hawkish members of mr obamas cabinet it is no surprise then that as a presidential candidate she is well to the right of mr sanders and even mr obama she has called for greater us involvement in the syrian civil war including enforcing a no fly zone and supports a continued us military presence in afghanistan bernie sanders generally agrees with barack obamas foreign policies limited involvement in syria and an emphasis on working with us allies he contrasts himself with mister clinton by noting the past us military action that she supported and he opposed in libya and iraq he supports a full us withdrawal from afghanistan and no us training of rebels in the syrian civil war john f kennedys foreign policy as president compared to the current crop of democratic politicians seems downright bellicose he was an interventionist at heart authorising the bay of pigs invasion of cuba taking a hard line against soviet expansion in the western hemisphere and initiating us involvement in

1037,a south korean naval vessel fired five shots as a warning to a north korean patrol boat that briefly moved south of the countries disputed boundary line in the yellow sea seouls defense ministry said monday a south korean military official told the yonhap news agency that the north korean vessel retreated northward after the warning shots were fired into the water however the incident underscores the heightened hostilities between the two koreas the brief encounter came hours after the united nations security council condemned north koreas launch of a long range rocket that world leaders described as a banned test of ballistic missile technology and south koreas president called another intolerable provocation north korean leader kim jong un went ahead with the launch just two hours after an eight day window opened early sunday and a month after the countrys fourth nuclear test he ignored an appeal from china its neighbor and important ally not to proceed and in another slap to beijing he chose to launch the rocket on the eve of chinese new year the countrys most important holiday china and the united states have been negotiating the text of a new security council sanctions resolution since pyongyangs jan 6 nuclear test which it claimed was a hydrogen bomb that claim has been met with outside skepticism the us backed by japan and south korea wants tough un sanctions reflecting kims defiance of the security council but diplomats say china the norths key protector in the council is reluctant to impose economic measures that could not cause north koreas economy to collapse and a flight of north koreans into china across their shared border the 15 member security council strongly condemned the launch and pledged to expeditiously adopt a new resolution with further significant measures un code for sanctions the word robust referring to the measures was in an initial draft but was dropped in the final statement us ambassador samantha power told reporters that it cannot be business as usual after two successive north korean acts that are hostile and illegal whats important is that the security council unites power said china is a critical player we are hopeful that china like all council members will see the grave threat to regional and international peace and security see the importance of adopting tough unprecedented measures breaking new ground here exceeding the expectations of kim jong un he said a new resolution should do the work of reducing tension of working toward denuclearization (of the korean peninsula) of maintaining peace and stability and of encouraging a negotiated solution i believe the council needs to work together for a new resolution liu added indicating that china may want negotiations with the united states to be widened russias un ambassador vitaly churkin whose country is also a north korean ally said it has to be a weighty resolution but it also has to be a reasonable resolution that doesn t lead to north koreas economic or humanitarian collapse or further heighten tensions russias goal is to see six party talks aimed at denuclearization resume he said but in the current atmosphere thats unlikely because the north koreans have been very unreasonable and are challenging the entire international community we think this is wrong for their national interests for the korean peninsula for the region churkin said north korea which calls its launches part of a peaceful space program said it had successfully put a new earth observation satellite the kwangmyongsong 4 or shining star 4 into orbit less than 10 minutes after liftoff and vowed more such launches a us official said it might take days to assess whether the launch was a success but in pyongyang north koreans celebrated the launch with an official fireworks display monday night state broadcaster kctv reported according to cnn japans un ambassador motohide yoshikawa told reporters the missile which went over japan and landed near the philippines was a clear threat to the lives of many people the security council underscored that launches using ballistic missile technology even if characterized as a satellite launch or space launch vehicle contribute to north koreas development of systems to deliver nuclear weapons and violate four security council resolutions dating back to the norths first nuclear test in 2006 north korea under kim jong un has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless washington scraps what pyongyang calls a hostile policy meant to collapse kims government in a development that will worry both pyongyang and beijing a senior south korean defense ministry official yoo jeh seung told reporters that seoul and washington have agreed to begin talks on a possible deployment of the thaad missile defense system in south korea north korea has long decried the 28 500 us troops stationed in south korea and beijing would see a south korean deployment of thaad which is one of the worlds most advanced missile defense systems as a threat to its interests in the region in a statement north koreas national aerospace development administration in typical propaganda laden language praised the fascinating vapor of juche satellite trailing in the clear and blue sky in spring of february on the threshold of the day of the shining star juche is a north korean

3443,washington (reuters) president donald trump faces an uphill fight convincing the supreme court it should grant his emergency request to reinstate his travel ban on people entering the united states from six predominantly muslim countries his legal team on thursday night asked the nine justices to allow his controversial march 6 executive order to take effect immediately despite being blocked by lower courts the supreme court rarely grants emergency requests at issue is a ban trump has said is necessary to protect americans from terrorist attacks critics say his reasoning is flawed and assail the ban as discriminatory trumps proposed ban was a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign the fight over the emergency application is likely to determine whether the ban ever takes effect that is because if the court grants the request the bans 90 day term will have expired by the time the court decides the legal fate of the proposal the 5 4 conservative majority on the high court means trump a republican who took office on jan 20 likely has a better chance than he has had to date in more liberal leaning lower courts “even though it is a heavy lift getting a stay it seems to me that the supreme court is the most favorable court they ve had access to so far said john elwood a washington lawyer the administration needs five votes on the nine justice court to put the ban into effect in this instance the merits of whether it violates the us constitutions ban on religious discrimination by targeting muslims matter less the court weighs several factors when considering emergency applications one such application met with success when in february 2016 the court granted on a 5 4 vote a request by states and industry groups to block president barack obamas climate regulations under supreme court precedent several criteria need to be met for an emergency application to be granted including that there would be “irreparable harm if denied and that there is a “reasonable probability the court would agree to hear the case on the merits in the governments request acting solicitor general jeff wall wrote that the nationwide injunctions blocking the travel ban have caused irreparable harm by “preventing the executive from effectuating his national security judgment the challengers contest the administration claim that urgent action is needed to protect americans from terrorist attacks they stress that the government did not previously ask the supreme court to intervene even when lower courts denied earlier emergency applications seeking to lift the injunctions “this is different from the kind of case you would expect the supreme court to grant the extraordinary relief of a stay because of the lack of any demonstrable urgency or harm and because the law and the facts are on our side said american civil liberties union lawyer omar jadwat on friday the court asked the challengers including the aclu and hawaii to file responses to the trump requests by june 12 the administration is then likely to file its own response to the challengers legal arguments before the justices issue an order granting or denying the administrations applications one thorny issue the supreme court may have to resolve if it grants the stay is whether the 90 day ban trump sought to impose would begin from the day of the courts action or whether the clock has been ticking throughout the litigation meaning it would expire in mid june challengers will argue for the latter which would mean it is almost set to expire that would limit the practical impact if the application were granted the courts conservative majority includes justice anthony kennedy he sometimes sides with the courts four liberals and could not be the pivotal vote the travel bans challengers have relied in part on a concurring opinion kennedy wrote in a 2015 supreme court immigration case kennedy wrote that in the immigration context the governments actions can be questioned if there is evidence of bad faith another conservative justice is the man trump appointed to the high court neil gorsuch during his us senate confirmation hearing gorsuch vowed not to be a

725,president obama on tuesday escalated his criticism of donald trump calling him “unfit to serve as president as the republican presidential nominee faced censure from members of both parties for disparaging the parents of a fallen army captain “the notion that he would attack a gold star family that made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country the fact that he doesn t appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in europe in the middle east in asia means that he is woefully unprepared to do this job obama said at the white house during a news conference with the prime minister of singapore obama also challenged republican leaders to go beyond distancing themselves from trump saying their objections “ring hollow as long as they still pledge to vote for him “there has to come a point at which you say enough the president said reflecting on the novelty of his own remarks obama said his warning stands apart from his criticism of his own republican presidential rivals sen john mccain (r ariz) and former massachusetts governor mitt romney with whom he disagreed on “certain policy issues but whose qualifications and “basic decency he didn t dispute “and had they won i would have been disappointed but i would have said to all americans    this is our president and i know they re going to abide by certain norms and rules and common sense obama said “but thats not the situation here the presidents remarks pinpointed republican divisions he also made clear that democrats have disagreements of their own by underscoring his commitment to the 12 nation trans pacific partnership the democratic candidate he hopes will succeed him hillary clinton opposes the deal which is awaiting ratification in congress “right now i m president and i m for it obama said obamas was the latest in a volley of complaints this week against trump whose campaign responded in a statement denouncing the president as a “failed leader who has wreaked havoc around the world bipartisan and among the most sustained of the election cycle the criticism of trump has mainly been a response to his denigration of khizr and ghazala khan immigrants from pakistan who appeared last week at the democratic national convention to denounce him for his harsh rhetoric about muslims they said their son who was killed in iraq would have been barred from entering the country under trumps proposed ban but the broadsides have also focused on the nominees comments about foreign relations including his apparent ignorance of russias annexation of the ukrainian territory of crimea in 2014 and his appeal to russian actors to expose clintons emails in response trump has laughed off concerns about his overtures to russian president vladi­mir putin saying warmer relations would help the united states pursue its international objectives such as defeating islamic state militants at a campaign event tuesday in ashburn versus trump attacked clinton for having a poor relationship with putin saying “this is a nuclear country we are talking about russia strong nuclear country “their stuff is newer    they have a lot more he said “she wants to play the tough one shes not tough [in clash with khans trump went too far some strategists say] meanwhile a kremlin spokesman told nbc news this week that putin has never had any contact with trump which is in line with a recent statement by trump that he has not spoken to putin and yet in direct conflict with the real estate moguls prior declarations including in 2014 at the national press club when trump said he had been in moscow and had spoken “indirectly and directly with the russian president in his hour long remarks on tuesday delivered at a local high school trump repeated his grave warnings about immigration across the southern border from mexico as well as from countries beset by islamic radicalism because “we don t know if they re isis trump said of migrants from the middle east the result would be “the all time great trojan horse he didn t mention the khans who have proven themselves dogged in their campaign against trump or new evidence that the candidates approach is driving a wedge in the republican party rep richard hanna (r ny) on tuesday became the first sitting republican member of congress to say publicly that he plans to vote for clinton declaring in an interview with syracusecom that trump is a “national embarrassment the three term congressman who represents a swath of upstate new york near syracuse but is not running for reelection this year has bucked his party in the past on issues ranging from gay marriage to climate change he declared his support for clinton in an opinion piece published tuesday on the news website and elaborated in an interview that trumps prolonged feud with the parents of a muslim american army captain killed in iraq was the final straw “i saw that and felt incensed hanna said in the interview “i was stunned by the callousness of his comments he added “i think trump is a national embarrassment is he really the guy you want to have the nuclear codes? hanna had already said he would not vote for trump a stance shared by a handful of his republican colleagues but his pronouncement that he would therefore support clinton a woman reviled by much of his party dealt yet another blow to trump as his poll numbers dip in the wake of the conventions and as his campaign struggles under mounting criticism over his response to the khans whose son humayun was killed in 2004 at age 27 by a car bomber in iraq trump said khizr khan had “no right to assail him and suggested that ghazala khan was barred by her muslim faith from speaking alongside her husband the quarrel continued into this week as trump tweeted that khan had “viciously attacked him and had shifted focus from the real concern “radical islamic terrorism the republican party nominee faced strong criticism from a bipartisan group of decorated combat veterans members of congress and family members of slain soldiers a particularly lengthy and impassioned rebuke came from mccain the senate armed services committee chairman who was a prisoner of war in vietnam “while our party has bestowed upon him the nomination it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us mccain said [broad array of military luminaries condemn trump over attacks on khans] on tuesday trump addressed the matter only implicitly faulting the media for not giving enough attention to patricia smith a trump supporter who is the mother of a victim of the benghazi attacks while giving “other people unbelievable amounts of air in fact multiple networks including cnn and msnbc carried smiths speech at the republican national convention live while fox news whose host brian kilmeade criticized other networks for not covering smith did not trump also said his critics would never desert him because they fear a supreme court stacked with clinton appointees he recounted his own comments from a campaign stop in pennsylvania in which he said he told his audience that “even if people don t like me they have to vote for me “i said even if you can t stand donald trump you think donald trump is the worst you re going to vote for me you know why? justices of the supreme court he said “if they pick judges we are going to end up with

520,it was only a cruel twist of fate that they were even watching cnn three months ago ted cruzs senior advisers were gathered around the makeshift bar at the iowa state fairgrounds where the texas senator was set to hold what would soon be his iowa caucus victory party they d been informed earlier in the day that the venue wouldn t be able to stream fox news the preferred network of republican events but cnn had offered to hook up its feed so campaign manager jeff roe chief strategist jason johnson senior adviser david polyansky then communications director rick tyler and others were watching as jake tapper and dana bash broke in with surprising news minutes before the caucuses were set to begin ben carson one of cruzs rivals for the affection of religious republicans wasn t headed straight to new hampshire but florida for some rest with their adrenaline pumping in what was expected to be a razor thin race against donald trump cruzs top operatives quickly sprung to action scrambling to tell their vast network of supporters about carsons plans “cnn is reporting that ben carson will stop campaigning after iowa make sure to tell all of your peers said the message pushed to users of the cruz mobile app an email read “carson is taking time off from the campaign trail “it wouldn t have had the impact it did if cnn wasn t on said tyler who was among the cruz aides watching in awe at the televised report which did not mention that their own reporter had also tweeted carson was staying in the race “it absolutely wouldn t have happened because we are all staring at the screen saying did you all hear what they said? the cruz messages about carson seemed benign enough especially in a rough and tumble 2016 campaign that has seen trump encourage violence at his rallies mimic the disabled on stage and mock his one female rivals physical appearance but carson was deeply aggrieved he would stay in the race through super tuesday dividing the religious right and after he quit carson would continue to hold the iowa messages against the texas senator questioning cruzs ethics and morals he would later endorse trump a man who once suggested carson was a child molester so deep was carsons disdain for cruz for cruz the episode opened the door to questions of trustworthiness that would dog him for the duration and it helped birth one of trumps most damning epithets “lyin ted cruz would go on to win iowa that night but the episode with carson fairly or not fueled the characterization of cruz long disseminated by washington republicans that the gentleman from texas was too slick too ambitious too unlikeable to ever be the nominee let alone president but cruz powered by the most organized adept and strategic campaign of the cycle would go on to win hundreds of delegates and nine states he began the race as an afterthought and went on to outlive jeb bush outlast marco rubio and outmaneuver trump at the arcane shadow game of selecting individual delegates who might be loyal he surpassed all expectations for a candidate who few gave much of a chance at the start cruz paired a distilled brand of pure conservatism with an instinct for the depth of anger in the electorate that few others saw he raised millions from small donors and built a big money operation too there was even a brief moment almost exactly four weeks ago in wisconsin when cruzs inner circle truly believed they had a clear path to victory forcing trump into a contested convention and winning on a second or third ballot in his milwaukee victory speech cruz hailed wisconsin as a “turning point he was right about that he was wrong about the direction the race was about to turn just when cruz had emerged as trumps sole serious challenger he needed to win over the same republican party insiders he had built his career running against; he needed them to rally around him their problem wasn t with cruzs hard line conservative principles it was his hard edged personality and political practices they all had carson stories of their own “the idea that there is ever been a spokesperson less equipped to make an argument for party unity i don t think there is anybody said josh holmes who served as senate republican leader mitch mcconnells chief of staff when cruz arrived in the senate in 2012 so many of his congressional colleagues and mainstream republicans stayed on the sidelines some embraced trump others attacked cruz including former speaker john boehner who called him “lucifer in the flesh a few endorsed half heartedly they might have feared trump but they loathed cruz one of cruzs few endorsers lindsey graham compared the choice to poison or being shot “which one of ted cruzs issues are they out of line with? what is it that they re so out of line with? asked tyler who resigned as cruzs communications director in february “it is petulance and it is petty and it is small it was also damaging just as cruz was about to run into a demographic buzzsaw after constructing his campaign around a conservative base and religious right he launched his bid at the worlds largest evangelical university the race in april turned to the more secular northeast cruz would lose not just the next six states but every county in them then on tuesday cruz made his last failed stand in indiana he lost in a landslide “it all really happened very suddenly said one cruz source “we were on a high after wisconsin fundraising was going great we knew we were going to lose new york and the acela primary not a big surprise but when it happened it just had a different impact the margins of trumps victory hurt us we are all still trying to come to terms with it ourselves from the start cruzs campaign was unusually open about the process and planning that went into running for president the week of his surprise announcement at liberty university he and his team were talking openly about the four “lanes in the race tea party libertarian evangelical and establishment cruz they said would compete to consolidate three of them all but the traditional “establishment republican lane filled with familiar names like rubio chris christie and bush cruzs goal was simple no one would outflank him on the right on policy and no one would outflank him on anger with the republican elites he succeeded on the former but trump dominated him on the latter that consolidation strategy was borne not just of cruzs political pedigree but also of the 2016 calendar a spate of southern states had jumped the line to vote on march 1 in what became known as the sec primary evangelical rich texas georgia alabama arkansas oklahoma and tennessee would vote that day as campaign manager roe bragged to politico last fall “my 19 month old daughter couldn t color a map thats better for us but after cruz carried iowa an ominous warning sign came in south carolina where trump carried what was supposed to be cruzs base winning evangelical voters 33 percent to 27 percent according to exit polling indeed trumps southern success would repeat itself on super tuesday a day cruz himself had once described as his firewall trump collected 254 of the delegates up for grabs that day outpacing cruzs haul of 218 almost half of which came from texas cruzs strategists had constructed their entire campaign to push through the latter half of the calendar with the lead but after super tuesday cruz was running from behind his team launched an alternative plan to deny trump the outright win and take the nomination to a contested convention and for a while it appeared to be working over the course of march and april as trump racked primary win after primary win cruzs data team shifted from targeting voters to identifying state activists who might serve as loyal delegates in cleveland and suddenly cruz looked like he was back on track his team was able to sell the idea that keeping trump from clinching was the gops last chance to save the party from a celebrity billionaire few would classify as conservative suddenly cruz was winning the race he thought would matter but he was doing something else in turn handing trump a claim many republicans saw as legitimate cruz trump said was trying to snatch the nomination away from the man republican voters clearly preferred trump wasn t the first candidate to question cruzs integrity rubio tagged him as “calculated (and his super pac used the tagline “calculated a play on cruzs “trusted slogan) supporters of mike huckabee attacked cruz in iowa for not tithing even carly fiorina cruzs short lived future running mate said in january of cruz “he says whatever he needs to say to get elected but as the 2016 field narrowed it was the “lyin ted label that increasingly stuck to cruz just as trumps “low energy moniker clung mercilessly to bush and it deeply irked cruz a detail oriented lawyer who parses his words as closely as any politician according to those close to him trump said it dates from the iowa caucus episode with carson “i call him lyin ted cruz after what he did to ben carson and many other things trump told sean hannity in late march “you know he lies he really lies the fact that cruz had spent months and months praising trumps every move in 2015 only to turn into his harshest critic when it became politically expedient in early 2016 only fed into trumps caricature when it comes to donald trump i like donald trump i think hes terrific i think hes brash i think he speaks the truth cruz had gushed last june “i have been glad to praise donald trump cruz boasted last august in september cruz even invited trump to keynote a rally he was organizing at the foot of the capitol last year cruz would chide the press as small minded for their efforts to goad him into criticizing whatever trumps latest outlandish statement was “the establishments only hope trump & me in a cage match cruz tweeted in december to diffuse tensions ahead of a debate “sorry to disappoint @realdonaldtrump is terrific #dealwithit but as he feuded with trump in the final three months of the race he blamed the same media he d accused of stoking tensions for now giving trump a free pass he said executives wanted to boost ratings and revenue or that they were secret democrats out to help hillary clinton by the end cruz wasn t just lashing out at the mainstream media as he had from the beginning but some of the key conservative organs of the right hannity fox news and the drudge report to name a few in january cruz had hailed the drudge report as a valuable avenue to bypass media gatekeepers but in april he said drudge was in trumps pocket “the drudge report has basically become the attack site for the donald trump campaign still four weeks ago when cruz strode onto the stage at milwaukees american serb hall many in his campaign believed they were watching the likely republican nominee according to internal polls cruz had come from behind to land a victory in wisconsin that was fueled not only by his traditional conservative base but by a new coalition of women more centrist republicans and young people cruz had been talking for months about conservatives coalescing behind his campaign now it was actually happening his campaign hoped that wisconsin a more diverse blue collar state would offer a blueprint for how cruz could not break through as the race headed into rougher territory in the more moderate northeast “my theory was if we can expand this coalition the way we did in wisconsin we can go into the northeastern states it is a trump stronghold we don t have to win but we have to be strong said one knowledgeable cruz source “well what a fucking disaster that was back before the iowa caucuses cruzs campaign had conceived of a clever line defining trump as a liberal without explicitly attacking him accusing him of “new york values it was straight out of roes old playbook in his missouri days roe had successfully beaten an opponent by hammering her “san francisco values it worked in iowa but as the race actually turned to new york three months later the line hung around cruz like an albatross meanwhile the countrys most aggressive press corps lay in wait “take the f u train ted the cover of the new york daily news greeted him in the liberal northeast cruz began to talk more and more about winning the loyalties of delegates at party conventions and the need to stop trump and less about his conservative agenda “somewhere after wisconsin our message became we hate trump everybody hates trump i m going to beat trump and wow we ve got this awesome convention delegate counting thing because we are so good at process the cruz source said “thats a problem thats not ted being ted … it is just what the story became it seems like we weren t able to do anything about it “the wisconsin win the cruz source continued “was the biggest day in the campaign we all thought we were going to get it but after the win we started trending down in every state state by state cruz finished third in new york with less than 15 percent of the vote more than 35 percentage points behind trump the margin was devastating state sen michael hough cruzs maryland campaign chair said cruz had had a path to collecting at least some delegates in maryland immediately after wisconsin but after getting blown out in new york all momentum halted “for a short time there was some hope we could not do something for him hough said “but i think the new york thing the media idea that oh it is over i think it swung all the momentum to trump a week after new york cruz would lose not just maryland pennsylvania rhode island delaware and connecticut but every county and congressional district in those states the only state cruz would win delegates in was rhode island; he never campaigned there cruzs inner circle gathered this monday it was not a conversation his team had expected to have just weeks after winning big in wisconsin but the day before the indiana primary there they were gathered in the seventh floor offices of cruzs houston headquarters discussing the senators suddenly shaky future “it was the first time there was any discussion about it in that senior staff meeting which happened every monday said someone close to the campaign “the polls continued to show we weren t going to do well in indiana thats where things were going then the question became ok what happened what do you do next? “it was really after the losses of last week the magnitude of the trump victories the fact that he broke 50 percent 60 percent said another cruz source involved “it destroyed our narrative that there is a ceiling to his support chad sweet cruzs campaign chairman and an old friend was adamant in the monday meeting that the senator would stay in regardless of indiana according to two sources but not everyone agreed the discussion stretched beyond 2016 to cruzs senate seat and his political future still cruz had 9 dollars million in the bank after all and some of his allies saw no downside to staying in as long as trump didn t have the needed delegates but by the time polls opened in indiana cruz had already pulled every political stunt he could not to blunt trumps momentum he d struck a pact with john kasich to pull out of indiana in exchange for cruz abandoning two later states and he d named his vice presidential pick fiorina less than 24 hours after he had been mathematically eliminated from winning the republican nomination it was a blatant play to draw attention it didn t work the new york times didn t even devote a separate story to the announcement for the printed edition instead pairing it with bernie sanders cutting back his staff “failing hopefuls regroup to save their campaigns read the headline cruz did get a spike on social media but it didn t last the next day boehner calling him “lucifer and a “miserable son of a bitch drowned out fiorina with 82 428 mentions of cruz and boehner compared with 66 434 for cruz and fiorina according to zignal labs which tracks digital conversation tyler said the cruz campaign had been in a bind “doing nothing would have been dumb he said “doing something was smart and so it was a smart move but in terms of the timing sometimes you don t have a choice you know whats going to happen but you have to do it anyway cruz allies bristled toward the end that the so called never trump movement never fully embraced him and that those who did did so too late some in the campaign blamed kasichs refusal to drop out for preventing a unification around cruz “he clearly hurt us said a source close to the campaign but cruzs lack of relationships loomed large “we all know that ted cruz is hated by every human being in washington that draws breath said rick wilson a republican strategist who has worked in opposition to trump “ted not having a lot of friends in dc it adds ups ultimately there was nothing left to try cruz woke up on the morning of the indiana primary to rain and the news that trump was touting a national enquirer story that claimed without evidence that his father was involved in john f kennedys assassination the day would only get worse in a heated news conference the usually measured cruz unleashed he called trump “amoral and a “serial philanderer leveling the kinds of accusations that he had proudly avoided for the entirety of the campaign and he aimed once again to push back on the “lyin ted moniker with which trump had so effectively tagged him this man is a pathological liar he doesn t know the difference between truth and lies cruz said “in a pattern that is straight out of a psychology text book he accuses everyone of lying cruz suffered indignity after indignity in the lead up to the indiana primary from a squalling child protester whom he found himself scolding to his would be running mate falling off a stage in a video that went viral in political circles and on monday in another video that dominated the day cruz engaged with trump protesters one of whom took to simply yelling “lyin ted! as the senator sought to make his points cruz had had enough he made the final call tuesday in a meeting with roe his campaign manager and johnson his chief strategist some staffers had already been bracing for the news after being told to fly to indianapolis from houston on tuesday many were informed by texts from roe thanking them for their hard work less than an hour before cruz made the announcement official in a sign of the tight ship roe ran the news did not leak out until roe himself walked over to a small group of reporters at the watch party minutes before cruz took the stage and gave the texas tribune reporter the go ahead to tweet the development fiorina was still speaking on stage

2037,yesterday the leftist media spent the day wringing their hands in anticipation of finally pinning a russian collusion story on president trump after general flynn admitted to lying to the fbi about meeting with russian ambassador sergey kislyak during the trump transition period it now appears that flynns testimony is a big nothingburger in fact if the media was being honest with the american people they would be telling them that flynns admission doesn t hold a candle to the lies former president barack obamas regime was caught telling barack obamas regime lied about matters that actually were much more serious in nature many of their lies were about covering up for the deaths of innocent americans from obamas crooked former ag eric holder who lied about the illegal gun running program fast n furious that was responsible for the death of us border agent brianterry to the lies his former national security advisor susan rice told when she went on a media blitz to knowingly lie when she told americans the death of 4 americans in benghazi was caused by a video it is got to be pretty bad when a staunch obama media ally the washington post tells him he should fire his cia director john brennan for lying from the washington post in march at the council on foreign relations cia director john brennan was asked by nbcs andrea mitchell whether the cia had illegally accessed senate intelligence committee staff computers to thwart an investigation by the committee into the agencys past interrogation techniques the accusation had been made earlier that day by sen dianne feinstein (d calif) who said the cia had violated the separation of powers principles embodied in the united states constitution brennan answered as far as the allegations of you know cia hacking into you know senate computers nothing could not be further from the truth i mean we wouldn t do that i mean thats thats just beyond the you know the scope of reason in terms of what we would do { }and you know when the facts come out on this i think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrongwatch brennan lie to andrea mitchell here now we know that the truth was far different the posts greg miller reports cia director john o brennan has apologized to leaders of the senate intelligence committee after an agency investigation determined that its employees improperly searched computers used by committee staff to review classified files on interrogations of prisoners { }a statement released by the cia on tuesday acknowledged that agency employees had searched areas of that computer network that were supposed to be accessible only to committee investigators agency employees were attempting to discover how congressional aides had obtained a secret cia internal report on the interrogation program some employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding reached between the cia and lawmakers in 2009 when the committee investigation was launched according to the agency statement which cited a review by the cias inspector general the cia statement was first reported by mcclatchythat committees investigation is said to be sharply critical of the cia finding that it exaggerated the effectiveness of harsh interrogation measures and repeatedly misled members of congress and the executive branch the findings are expected to be released publicly within weeksafter briefing committee leaders brennan apologized to them for such actions by cia officers as described in the [inspector general] report the agency statement said brennan also ordered the creation of an internal personnel board led by former sen evan bayh (d ind) to review the agency employees conduct and determine potential disciplinary measures an apology and an internal review board might suffice if this were brennan or intelligence leaders first offense but the track record is far from spotless in 2011 brennan claimed that dozens of us drone strikes on overseas targets had not killed a single civilian this remarkable success rate was not only disputed at the time by news reports even supporters of the drone program called it absurd but as the bureau of investigative journalism and the new york times both reported later president obama received reports from the very beginning of his presidency about drone strikes killing numerous civilians as obamas top counterterrorism adviser at the time brennan would have received these reports as well so either brennan knew that his claim was a lie or he is secretly deaf similarly brennan denied snooping on senate computers six weeks after feinstein first made the accusation to the cia in private which means either that he was lying or he had ignored a serious charge against his agency for six weeks then spouted off about it without any real knowledge hardly the behavior expected of an agency directorand last year director of national intelligence james clapper lied under oath to congress when he told sen ron wyden (d ore) and the senate intelligence committee that the national security agency did not collect any kind of data on millions of americans a claim later disproved by documents leaked by former nsa employee edward snowden despite clapper receiving criticism from both sides of the aisle the damage to clappers and the white houses credibility on intelligence and civil liberties issues and well the fact that lying to congress is a crime (though one thats difficult to prosecute) obama has not disciplined clapper in any way.,FAKE

453,marco rubio needing a breakout performance going into tuesdays florida primary changed tactics and used substance during thursday nights republican party debate to attack donald trump on several fronts while trump subdued and trying to look more presidential held steady to the campaign tested themes that have made him the front runner at the end of the two hour debate trump coming off a string of primary wins summed up the reality that rubio and rivals ted cruz and john kasich face that only “two of us can get the delegates to win meaning trump and cruz and “two of us cannot referring to rubio and kasich “that is not meant to be a criticism … thats just a mathematical fact trump said urging the party to “be smart and unify the reminder amounted to just about the toughest criticism of the night at a debate where personal attacks were replaced by more substantive policy discussion but rubio in particular who drastically changed his campaign approach in recent weeks to turn up the heat on trump and even mock his physical appearance dialed all that back onstage thursday after having said he regrets some of those personal insults instead he hit trump on his defense of his “islam hates us remarks trumps suggestion he d do a deal with the palestinians and his vow that he wouldn t touch social security despite warnings it would start running out of money in two decades trumps rivals though did not criticize him after he was asked about whether his tone is encouraging violence at his rallies a reference to a recent incident where a protester was punched “i hope not i truly hope not trump said saying he does not condone violence but also that some protesters are bad dudes one of the most pointed debate clashes came over the diplomatic thaw with cuba a huge issue in florida host of the cnn debate and next weeks critical primary trump tangled with his rivals as he claimed hes “in the middle on the issue trump said “something should take place after a decades long freeze but “i want to get a much better deal whether rubios performance is enough is the big question pressure was already mounting on him to drop out and texas sen cruz added to that pressure thursday night “there are only two of us who have a path to winning the nomination donald and myself cruz said while also jokingly referring to trump as the “son of a businessman rubio entered the debate clinging to life in the republican party primary race after a string of losses he depends on winning his home state of florida on tuesday but polls show trump well ahead there and even if rubio wins florida it is still unclear whether he would have any path to the nomination but he along with his rivals did their best thursday to draw distinctions between them and trump oftentimes trump seemed to lean on his “art of the deal to explain his approach to global challenges but it earned him criticism from the others on stage cruz hammered trump for suggesting he d be able to re negotiate a nuclear deal with iran “i will rip to shreds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal cruz countered trump also took heat from rubio and others as he defended his claim that “islam hates us the republican front runner said there is “tremendous hatred in the muslim world and called for new laws to confront the threat “we better expand our laws or we are being a bunch of suckers and they are laughing at us trump said but rubio and cruz both said “of course they would not want to allow the targeting of family members of terror targets as trump has called for and they chided him for his remarks “the answer is not scream all muslims bad cruz said “the problem is presidents can t just say whatever they want rubio said “i m not interested in being politically correct … i m interested in being correct trumps rivals noted america must work with other muslim nations to confront the isis threat trump also took heat for saying he d try to do a deal with the palestinians as well as the israelis for the most part trump and his three republican presidential rivals held their personal fire thursday night during their last debate before next tuesdays primary in florida which votes alongside four other states trump even remarked on the subdued tone “so far i cannot believe how civil it is been up here i think it was good that we had a substantive debate cruz told fox news megyn kelly late wednesday the last two debates were pretty ridiculous [and] i was glad to see that nonsense ending ohio gov kasich also stressed at the debate that hes run an “unwavering positive campaign all along but on the domestic front they did battle on the best way to save social security with trump breaking from his competition by saying he d leave it alone despite warnings it would start running out of money in two decades “i will do everything in my power not to touch social security trump said he said he d instead get rid of waste fraud and abuse including by

4680,chicago (reuters) target corp (tgtn) wal march stores inc (wmtn) and other retailers are shelving considerations to move supply bases closer to the united states in the face of a possible border tax banking instead on killing support for the tax idea in congress president donald trumps push to impose a tax on imports such as the 20 percent levy initiated by house republicans could not raise us consumer prices by as much as 25 percent industry officials said last week the president said he favored an import tax that could not be adjusted to reflect the country of origins tax rate for us products the decision by retailers to forestall supply chain investment in countries such as bolivia and romania to focus on lobbying congress shows how trumps ambitious agenda has instilled a new level of risk operating outside us borders but the vagueness around the tax proposals and whether they may ever be implemented means retail industry executives are still not willing to change their operating infrastructure the retail industry leaders association which is leading the industry lobbying effort has conducted 140 meetings with lawmakers since december focusing on the costs of a new tax and encouraging lawmakers who oppose the tax prospects for a quick passage of a tax bill took a hit last month when the republican attempt to overhaul the national healthcare law failed to get a vote in the us house of representatives trump and republican leaders have said they still intend to pass a healthcare reform law first casting further doubt on when congress may consider tax reform the border tax proposal likely will be “as messy as the healthcare bill according to brian dodge senior executive vice president of public affairs for the retail lobby group target for one thinks the industrys lobbying efforts are succeeding “we are working on educating lawmakers and president trump hasn t embraced it yet so we definitely think we are making progress a senior company official at target said on condition of anonymity there is good reason for retailers to fight the tax idea rbc capital markets forecast such a levy could not reduce profits of six large us retailers by as much as

off price chains like tjx cos (tjxn) and ross stores (rosto) to cosmetics seller ulta beauty (ultao) would feel less impact than heavy importers like wal march target and costco wholesale corp (costo) analysts and consultants said tjx companies and ulta beauty declined comment ross stores and costco did not respond to requests seeking comment steve osburn director of supply chain for retail consultancy kurt salmon said it is more cost effective to spend on lobbying than on supply chain relocation at this point retailers also have other investment needs especially around winning consumers who want to shop from home “they are putting a lot of money in e commerce initiatives to compete online so there are not a lot of funds to spare he said one outlier is luxury handbag maker rebecca minkoff which sells its own products and supplies other retailers like nordstrom inc (jwnn) and amazoncom inc (amzno) the prospect of a us border tax factored into its recent decision to supply us customers from europe as it mitigates logistics costs to supply to the united states according to uri minkoff the firms founder and ceo “the process has intensified in the past six months said minkoff the decision to bank more on the lobby effort to kill support for the tax idea comes after retailers spent the last few months considering whether to move some of their production to supply bases like bolivia brazil and other south american countries with low wage rates as well as european countries like hungary bulgaria and the czech republic industry sources told reuters a return to the united states was also a consideration the sources said shifting production from existing supply bases like china is costly may involve intellectual property issues and disrupts long term supply contracts making it hard to plan and execute such moves two industry sources said consultants have told retailers they could not mitigate shipping costs enough to offset any border tax while avoiding the cost of moving production into the us the sources said but so far they are not proceeding with major supply chain changes according to retailers and industry consultants “wal march is not ready to spend money to deal with this said a supply chain consultant who works with the retailer but requested anonymity for fear of disrupting the firms relationship with wal march wal march has reviewed its options with supply chain consultants but has not yet commissioned a concrete contingency plan sources with direct knowledge of the matter said wal march declined comment executives at smaller retailers and brands like samsonite crate and barrel and steve madden said there is little competitive impetus for action because they believe a border tax would hurt them and competitors equally samsonite was studying reviving its us manufacturing base but is not close to taking action “setting plans (based) on policy proposals that are yet to be implemented is not right samsonite chief executive officer ramesh tainwala told reuters minneapolis based target is limiting itself to conducting feasibility studies “we just don t want to get ahead of ourselves and invest capital the target

1905,edinburgh (reuters) scotlands devolved government has recommended that its parliament at holyrood withhold consent for legislation to withdraw britain from the european union on the grounds that it could not water down their powers a document filed by the scottish government said on tuesday the approval of the devolved parliaments in scotland and wales does not represent a veto to the brexit process although it would stretch britains constitutional tensions yet further by forcing the uk government of prime minister theresa may to ignore the expressed wish of the devolved bodies scotland would work with the welsh government to propose amendments to the bill which if agreement were reached would allow it to recommend its passage in the devolved assemblies the document said the bill will end the supremacy of eu law in the uk and convert all existing eu laws into domestic ones along with the welsh government the scottish government cannot recommend to the parliament that it gives consent to the bill as currently drafted the document filed with the scottish parliament said the scottish government is also clear that the result of withdrawal from the eu should not be centralization of power in whitehall and westminster however that is what the bill proposes scotlands first minister nicola sturgeon has been arguing that brexit as proposed flies in the face of the devolution agreement which up to now has allowed assemblies in edinburgh cardiff and belfast to legislate on their own domestic policies such as health and education scotland and northern ireland voted to keep eu membership in a june 2016 referendum while england and wales voted to leave it remains a matter of regret to the scottish government that the uk plans to withdraw from the eu the government nevertheless accepts that preparations should be made for withdrawal from the eu including preserving a functioning legal system the document said the scottish governments key objections to the bill as introduced relate to the provisions on the competence of the scottish parliament and government () and those on powers for uk and scottish ministers to alter domestic law it said the scottish and welsh governments argue that returning powers now exercised by the eu to the uk government will imply restrictions on the power of scottish and welsh chambers but britains scotland minister david mundell has said that the repeal will ultimately result in a boost in devolved parliamentary power.,REAL

that researchers had concluded as early as the 1980s that fossil fuel emissions were linked to global warming but actively sought to mislead the public jeffers says the articles conveniently left out some truth about the scientists conclusions during a 1989 presentation exxon scientist duane g levine told the board of directors that concerns about the “enhanced greenhouse effect resulting from human activity had been the subject of scientific study for some time but levine had said any linkage was “deeply imbedded in scientific uncertainty the stories also claimed the fossil fuel industry financed a distortion campaign by funding various think tanks including the competitive enterprise institute (cei) which received a subpoena from us virgin islands attorney general claude e walker an independent cei said it will “vigorously fight the subpoena “it is an affront to our first amendment rights of free speech and association for attorney general walker to bring such intimidating demands against a nonprofit group cei general counsel sam kazman said in a statement the subpoena seeks emails statements and other documents about ceis work on environmental issues as well as information about its donors jeffers says environmentalists have targeted them because “they can t blame the 7 billion people who consume fossil fuels every year so they blame us.,REAL

uber in court is it a digital service or an unlicensed taxi company? uber in court is it a digital service or an unlicensed taxi company? a protester holds her sign up as immigrants and community leaders rally in front of the us supreme court to march the one year anniversary of president obamas executive orders on immigration in washington on nov 20 2015 the supreme court on tuesday agreed to rule on the constitutionality of the plan to shield more than 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation setting the stage for a potential election year blockbuster decision the us supreme court has agreed to decide a texas case challenging president obamas executive action to shield from deportation more than 4 million undocumented immigrants the president announced the controversial policy in november 2014 but before it could not go into effect texas and 25 other states filed a lawsuit seeking to block the program a federal judge in texas issued an injunction and that action was upheld by a federal appeals court panel last year the justices decision on tuesday to weigh in on the immigration case means the high court will be examining yet another politically sensitive controversy in a presidential election year the justices are already expected to decide by late june cases examining state imposed abortion regulations the drafting of voting districts use of race in college admissions and whether public unions can require nonmembers to pay fees for collective bargaining specifically at issue in the case is whether a federal judge in texas acted properly in issuing an injunction to block the presidents executive action in an important signal of the potential magnitude of the dispute the high court instructed the lawyers to also address the most fundamental question raised in the litigation whether president obamas unilateral action to advance his immigration program violates the “take care clause of the us constitution article ii of the constitution sets out the duties of the president it includes the requirement that the president “shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed the issue is whether federal immigration statutes as passed by congress and signed into law by the president permit the kind of broad discretion for unilateral executive action claimed by the obama administration lawyers for the administration and for a group of undocumented immigrants who would benefit from the new immigration policies had asked the high court to lift the injunction and allow the obama immigration program to take effect they argue that the complaining states do not have the necessary legal standing to bring their lawsuit they also argue that the administration did not exceed its authority in adopting regulations that would grant deferred deportation status to several million undocumented immigrants and provide them with work permits republicans accuse the president of using his executive authority to usurp legislative power the constitution assigns to congress they say existing immigration laws bar the obama administration from deciding for itself that large categories of people should be granted special immigration status and authorization to work administration officials and democratic supporters argue that us immigration laws grant expansive discretion to federal officials to decide how best to enforce those laws the presidents executive action on immigration fits easily within that wide zone of prosecutorial discretion they say texas solicitor general scott keller disputes that assertion he says the presidents executive action on immigration is one of the largest changes in immigration policy in american history “the executive claims the power to ignore [federal immigration] statutes and unilaterally deem lawful the presence of any unauthorized alien it chooses not to remove mr keller wrote in his brief urging the supreme court to allow the injunction to remain in place “moreover he added “the executive asserts that it may do so for millions of aliens without even using conventional notice and comment procedures usually when a federal agency like the department of homeland security writes new regulations it provides notice of the action and an opportunity to receive public comments the obama administration decided that it did not have to engage in this process when writing its new immigration regulations “[the presidents executive action] is a crucial change in the nations immigration law and policy and that is precisely why it could not be created only by congress rather than unilaterally imposed by the executive keller said “law enforcement discretion does not confer the distinct power to deem unlawful conduct as lawful keller added in his brief to the court us solicitor general donald verrilli said the administrations new immigration provisions are partly necessary because congress has appropriated only enough money to support removal of 4 percent of deportable immigrants per year given those budget constraints the administration has sought to set priorities and focus its enforcement effort on those undocumented immigrants who pose the greatest danger to the american public such as criminals and terrorists he said in contrast he said most undocumented immigrants are hard working individuals trying to provide for their families since 2012 more than 600 000 individuals have been granted deferred deportation status and given work permits under an obama administration program aimed at children of undocumented immigrants who arrived in the us at an early age and who have lived in the country for an extended period that program is called deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) no legal challenge has been filed to that 2012 program the current litigation is aimed at the presidents november 2014 program which was meant to expand on district of columbia to include the parents of children who were born in the us or of children who have become legal permanent residents of the us that program is known by the acronym dapa (deferred access for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents) both programs were designed in part to encourage people to come out of the shadows submit to a background check pay certain fees get work authorization and be counted by the us government according to solicitor general verrilli he said the injunction is causing continuing harm to undocumented immigrants who are unable to live their lives openly in the us “it will force millions of people to continue to work off the books without the option of lawful employment to provide for their families verrilli wrote “and it will place a cloud over the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who came to the united states as children have lived here for years and been accorded deferred action under the 2012 district of columbia policy the presidents executive action promising to protect from deportation several million of an estimated 113 million unauthorized immigrants currently in the us is particularly popular in the latino community including with latino voters a high court decision upholding the presidents action would provide a substantial boost to democratic candidates nationwide in the final months before the november election in contrast the republican front runners for that partys nomination have stressed their opposition to the obama plan and the need to more strictly enforce immigration laws and control national borders some political analysts have warned that they risk alienating latino voters advocacy groups on both sides of the issue praised the high courts decision to take up the case “we applaud the supreme court for appropriately reserving time on its docket to decide this critical case before the current term ends in june elizabeth wydra chief counsel with the constitutional accountability center said in a statement “the presidents program has been delayed for far too long by this political lawsuit and the clearly erroneous decisions of the lower courts ms wydra said “the lives of millions of children and families in america have been disrupted and held in limbo a situation the presidents action was designed to alleviate and they deserve the courts careful and prompt attention carrie severino chief counsel at the judicial crisis network says the case presents an important opportunity for the justices to examine president obamas abuse of executive power “only congress can rewrite the immigration laws the obama administration has a long history of trying to get its way undemocratically and this case is no different she said in a statement “the supreme court has already blocked many of president obamas power grabs she said “this case will give the court yet another chance to do so the case is us v texas (15 674).,REAL

university in farmville versus unlike the people at the top of the tickets pence and kaine are relatively unknown to voters on the republican side pence has been governor of indiana since 2013 before that he served six terms in the us house of representatives house speaker paul ryan has called pence a good movement conservative and considers him a good friend i ve very high regard for him ryan said when pence was chosen as trumps running mate an indicator that putting pence on the ticket might have been an olive branch from the trump campaign to more traditional conservatives here are five other things to know about gov pence ahead of tuesdays debate pence is a born again christian he became one in college and has put his religion in the foreground of his political persona for me it all begins with faith it begins with what matters most and i try and put what i believe to be moral truth first my philosophy of government second and my politics third pence said in a 2010 appearance on the christian broadcasting network and religion has indeed played a large part in his policy decisions one notable example is his strong opposition to abortion while serving in the house in 2011 he introduced an amendment to defund planned parenthood because the womens health organization provides abortion services this march as governor of indiana pence signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country the law bans abortions due to fetal abnormalities and also requires aborted fetuses and those from miscarriage to be buried or cremated women in indiana protested the law by calling or tweeting at the governors office to tell him about their periods in an effort dubbed periods for pence trump and pence while different in temperament have something in common both men have hosted tv shows in the 1990s pence hosted a sunday tv show in indianapolis and also had a radio talk show called the mike pence show he described himself as rush limbaugh on decaf meaning while a conservative he was not as bombastic as the popular limbaugh who hosts his own talk show on his show pence discussed the weeks news and also his conservative values in a video from 1997 published this

called for basic human decency in july pence and trump sat down for a joint interview on cbs 60 minutes interviewer lesley stahl asked pence how he felt about some of trumps attacks on his opponents specifically referencing lyin ted trumps nickname for his last standing primary opponent texas sen ted cruz pence replied trump added that the two men are different people and he doesn t ask pence to be negative it is probably obvious to people that our styles are different but i promise you our vision is exactly the same pence added in 2015 he signed into law a controversial religious freedom bill which spurred wide backlash critics said the bill could not allow business owners to ban lgbt customers based on a claim of religious freedom after business civic and sports leaders strongly called for a fix to the legislation usa today noted pence later signed a revised version of the law but pence appeared to back the bill in an interview on fox in march 2015 well let me say first and foremost i stand by this law he said but i understand that the way that some on the left and frankly some in the national media have mischaracterized this law over the last week might make it necessary for us to clarify the law through legislation and we were working through the day and into the night last night with legislative leaders to consider ways to do that although his running mate has denied his own early support of the iraq war pence was in congress at the time and voted in favor of authorizing the use of force in iraq in a 2002 interview with cnn leading up to the vote pence emphasized that there was overwhelming evidence to suggest a connection between iraq and al qaeda which ended up not being the case when trump was asked for his opinion on pences 2002 vote on 60 minutes he answered hes entitled to make a mistake every once in awhile when pence was asked on fox news this year about the vote he said i think thats for historians to debate i supported president bushs decision to go into iraq as well as to go into afghanistan i traveled downrange for 10 years in a row to visit our soldiers in operation enduring freedom and operation iraqi freedom i stood

according to the us intel source “they took out almost all the military budget from their stated federal budget lulling the west into thinking that russia could not not afford a massive military buildup and there was nothing to fear from russia as they were finished as a world power the [stated] military budget was next to nothing so there was nothing to worry about as far as the cia was concerned if putin showed publicly his gigantic military buildup the west could not have taken immediate remedial actions as they did in 2014 by crashing the oil price the bottom line then would reveal the pentagon as totally unprepared for a hot war even as it threatens and bluffs russia now on a daily basis; “as brzezinski has pointed out if this is the case it means the us has ceased to be a global power the us may continue to bluff but those that ally with them will have nowhere to go if that bluff is called as it is being now called in syria the us intel source is adamant that “one of the greatest military buildups in history has taken place right under the nose of the russian central bank head elvira nabiullina and the russian ministry of finance while the cia awaits what they think will be the inevitable russia collapse the cia will be waiting forever and eternity for russia to collapse this mgb maneuver is sheer genius and demonstrates that the cia which is so drowned by data inputs that they cannot connect the dots on anything must be completely reorganized in addition the entire procurement system of the united states military must also be reorganized as it cannot ever keep up if new weapon programs as the f 35 take twenty years to develop and then are found obsolete before they even enter service the russians have a five year development program for each new weapons system and they are far ahead of us in every key area if this analysis is correct it goes against even the best and most precise russian estimates according to which military potential may be strong asymmetrically but still much inferior to us military might well informed western analysts know that moscow never brags about military buildups and has mastered to a fault the element of surprise much more than calling a bluff it is moscows sun tzu tactics that are really rattling loudmouth washington the essential saker from the trenches of the emerging multipolar world 2795 dollars.,FAKE

480,a&q is a special series that inverts the classic q&a taking some of the most frequently posed solutions to pressing matters of policy and exploring their complexity in modern politics nothing brings people together more than talking about how far apart they are twelve years ago a speech denouncing political polarization thrust barack obama into the national spotlight and that very premise will outlast him when he leaves the white house next january the american public is divided over economic policy social policy foreign policy race privacy and national security and many other things a host of factors from partisan gerrymandering to exclusionary party primaries are driving them further apart here we break down those factors behind our polarized politics along with some of the most common proposals to fix it political polarization is worse now than it is ever been lets stop right there is this really true? it is a common cry of politicians government reform advocates pundits journalists and disaffected voters to bemoan the state of politics and declare that “washington is broken perhaps irrevocably but people often forget that american history is rife with examples of debilitating polarization that make the partisan battles of today pale by comparison this was a key point president obama made in his recent speech to the illinois general assembly where he said that “it isn t true that todays issues are inherently more polarizing than the past a fundamental dispute over the institution of slavery plunged the nation into a civil war a century and a half ago in 1856 violence over slavery erupted in the august chamber of the us senate when an anti slavery lawmaker from massachusetts charles sumner was caned on the senate floor by a member of the house from south carolina preston brooks fans of the broadway hit hamilton have also been reminded of another black march on us political history when the nations first treasury secretary was killed in a duel by the sitting vice president aaron burr in 1804 more recently look at the emotional debates over racial equality and the vietnam war during the 1960s and 1970s the country witnessed the assassinations of john f and robert kennedy martin luther king and malcolm x the segregationist former governor of alabama george wallace was shot and paralyzed while he campaigned for president in 1972 rioting and civil unrest plagued major cities and college campuses across the countries for long stretches at a time fine the 1860s and the 1960s were bad but the fact that the nation hasn t fallen into civil war and our leaders haven t been gunned down is a pathetically low bar for a first world country with the greatest military and strongest economy on earth even during the tumult of the 1960s congress created medicare and medicaid enacted landmark civil rights legislation and passed a sweeping education bill that still serves as the foundation for federal funding of public schools today ever since obamas first two years in office congress hasn t done anything except shut down the government and come close to tanking the economy with a near default on the nations debt immigration reform stalled gun reform went nowhere congress can t even agree to declare war on isis and now that antonin scalia has died it might leave the supreme court short handed for more than a year congress is hopelessly gridlocked and we need major political reform to fix it whats wrong with congress? or more precisely is anything actually wrong with congress or is it simply functioning how it was designed to function? the confrontations over the last few years have led to rampant complaints that the national legislature is “dysfunctional which in turn has contributed to a stunningly low approval rating for congress (it sunk to single digits and has recently hovered in the low to mid teens) for one lawmakers in washington have struggled not only to pass big bills but they ve had trouble completing even the most routine tasks of governance in 2011 republicans refused for months to raise the debt limit and nearly caused an unprecedented default that could not have sunk the fragile economic recovery two years later conservatives forced a two and a half week government shutdown over funding for the healthcare law in the senate both parties and particularly republicans until last year have used the filibuster more frequently than ever before to stall legislation and presidential appointments this has led to calls to either reform the filibuster or scrap it entirely as a way to speed up the legislative process and make it easier for congress to reflect the will of the people in 2013 democrats did change the rules to make it easier to confirm executive and judicial appointees (below the supreme court) and republicans didn t bother to reverse those changes when they took control last year yet for all of the consternation if you are a democrat congress functioned quite well in the first two years of obamas term the house and senate passed so much significant legislation the stimulus bill health care student loans and wall street reform that the white house and congressional democrats had trouble explaining it all to voters then came the tea party wave of 2010 and the american people elected a republican house to serve as a check on the obama administration it is only natural that divided government would lead to some gridlock because congress was designed to only pass laws if there is a consensus in favor of them especially in the senate which was created as a check on the inflamed passions that would lead to political overreactions by the house so if you don t like how congress is working blame the founders which is exactly what my colleague yoni appelbaum did last year when he wrote that the gridlock on display in recent years may be “a product of flaws inherent in the constitutions design sure but the founders never imagined that partisan gerrymandering would render the house of representatives so polarized that most lawmakers now fear a primary challenge from the right or left more than they fear losing to the other party in a general election they have no incentive to compromise we need non partisan redistricting commissions to redraw the lines and make house members more accountable to people other than the extremes of each party well the founders never imagined political parties at all but that doesn t mean the system can t work is redistricting reform possible and would redrawing house districts help reduce polarization? the 435 congressional districts are redrawn every 10 years after the census and historically it has been the purview of state legislatures to determine the districts in their state naturally the party in power tends to draw them to maximize its advantage a process that over time has resulted in some totally ridiculous looking districts that stretch horizontally or diagonally across states or connect two population centers with a strip as thin as a single road the washington post did a good rundown of the most oddly shaped districts in 2014 the republican wave election in 2010 which extended from congress down to governorships and state legislatures gave the republican party significant power in redistricting after the decennial census that year the results were obvious in 2012 when republicans retained a large majority in house seats 234 201 despite the fact that democrats won 14 million more votes than republican party candidates in house races yet complaints about gerrymandering cross party lines when obama spoke in illinois it was the republicans in the state legislature who cheered his call for reform knowing that in the land of lincoln it is democrats who draw the districts and two retiring members of the gops tea party class of 2010 representatives richard hanna of new york and scott rigell of virginia blamed gerrymandering for some of the hyper partisanship they experienced during their years in congress good government groups have been pushing for states to turn over their redistricting process to non partisan or at least truly bipartisan commissions as a way to keep politicians from “picking their voters rather than the other way around this past june the supreme court gave a boost to these efforts by upholding the congressional map drawn by an independent commission in arizona that had been created through a successful ballot initiative the republican controlled state legislature had tried to invalidate the commissions map by arguing that the constitution vested the power to draw districts in the legislatures hands not the voters in a 5 4 opinion written by justice ruth bader ginsburg the high court sided with the voter empowered commission a dozen states including california currently use some form of a commission to draw districts and new york will turn to one after the 2020 census according to nyus brennan center for justice there are “serious reform efforts underway in an additional nine states given the intense interest state legislators have in keeping power over redistricting both on the local and federal level even reform advocates acknowledge it is difficult to see the total elimination of partisan gerrymandering across the country anytime soon as for whether redistricting commissions actually lead to less polarization that answer also is likely a long way off when california implemented its new map in 2012 there was a big increase in turnover in the states congressional delegation but it will take a while to assess whether those new legislators are any less partisan or more accountable to their constituents than their predecessors it is the parties themselves that are the problem they were never supposed to have this much influence over elections more and more voters consider themselves independent but in many district and statewide elections in heavily republican or democratic areas the only race that matters is the primary and independent voters often find themselves shut out every state should follow the california and nebraska model and adopt non partisan elections which empower more voters earlier in the electoral process would non partisan elections in place of party primaries re empower the political center by engaging more independent voters? thats the argument from the advocates behind open primaries a group that is pushing states nationwide to replicate the models in california which went to a “top two primary system in 2012 and nebraska which has had a non partisan state legislature since 1936 “top two or “jungle primaries are tailor made for districts or states that are dominated by one party in those elections whether in deep red rural areas or heavily liberal urban districts often the party primary is the only competitive race and the general election becomes a one sided affair if the primaries are reserved only for registered republicans or democrats independents are effectively shut out of the voting process and the election becomes a race to the right or left and rarely the center the idea behind creating a top two primary thats open to everyone is that voters would have two opportunities to legitimately weigh in and in districts or states where two members of the same party end up going up against each other it would force them to compete in the general election for the votes of the entire electorate not just the party base advocates hold up nebraska as an exemplar citing the fact that even though it is a conservative state its non partisan legislature has been able to reach agreement on bills to raise the gas tax abolish the death penalty and give drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants policies that would be unthinkable in many republican dominated states there are now efforts to enact non partisan elections through ballot initiatives in arizona and south dakota although supporters acknowledge that the idea hasn t yet gained much support in congress or reached a tipping point in many other states and opponents argue that non partisan elections would disproportionately benefit wealthy candidates who want to circumvent the party system as michael bloomberg did when he was elected mayor of new york and promptly tried and failed to implement non partisan elections in the city the solution is automatic voter registration or even compulsory voting like they have in australia would more engagement decrease polarization? it is possible one big critique of the current state of politics is that because such a low percentage of people typically vote those that do hold more power and they are more likely to be either very liberal or very conservative this is especially true in party primaries which often determine the winner in lopsided states and districts and in which the most motivated people are likeliest to vote oregon and california have enacted laws to automatically register people who have drivers licenses and who are otherwise eligible to vote hillary clinton has endorsed the policy nationally why americans are so polarized education and evolution two versions of america emerge in the presidential campaign in australia eligible citizens are required to vote and can face a fine or a court date if they don t not surprisingly the turnout rate there is more than 95 percent in a 2010 policy paper william galston of the brookings institution recommended that states experiment with compulsory voting as a way to reduce polarization and force candidates to appeal to a broader electorate needless to say that is unlikely to happen in the united states on a large scale anytime soon even the push for universal registration with the potential to opt out has drawn opposition from republicans who argue that people shouldn t be forced to participate if they don t want to there is also skepticism among conservatives that the effort is more about democrats trying to increase voting among minority and young voters who tend to lean their way and who vote less frequently than older white citizens lets be honest the real issue isn t gerrymandering or the parties it is money the influence of wealthy donors has only gotten more pronounced over the years and the supreme courts 2010 ruling in the citizens united case only tilted the scales even more in the direction of corporations and billionaires we need to overturn citizens united and fully adopt public financing of elections isn t money the root of all thats wrong in politics today? do we have any hope of reducing polarization if we can t get rid of the corrupting influence of money? there is no denying that politics is awash in money the presidential campaign is now a billion dollar industry and it takes millions of dollars to win races for governor senator and even some for the house the citizens united decision allowed wealthy interests to spend unlimited sums of money to run ads in support of or in opposition to candidates and the result has been an even greater flood of negative ads on television around election time yet while there are legitimate concerns about candidates being beholden to the billionaires supporting them money in politics doesn t flow entirely in the direction of polarization take bloomberg for example inarguably the billionaire businessman would not have been mayor of new york without the tens of millions he spent to win his elections but he is seen as a centrist figure in politics and has spent money on the national level decrying partisanship and dysfunction (even though he has taken partisan positions on certain issues like guns and climate change) big business groups like the us chamber of commerce also spend large sums of money to influence elections but while the chamber ardently opposes obamacare and environmental regulations costly to industry it sides with the establishment against the tea party in other areas and has spent heavily to back compromises on things like infrastructure bills and immigration reform money may tip the scales in favor of corporate interests and the whims of the wealthy but that doesn t always benefit the extremes in the end there may not be any one shot solutions or simple answers the present degree of political polarization didn t arise overnight and seems unlikely to dissipate that quickly either but even if they don t solve the entirety of the problem many voters are drawn to particular solutions and there is evidence that some can make at least an incremental difference these are some of the intriguing questions left to consider what does the shocking popularity of donald trump say about political polarization? is his success a reflection of a deep split or does it actually transcend polarization because he is winning support among republican voters despite having so many positions that contradict conservative orthodoxy? if the republican party really does split this summer what are the chances of a viable third party or independent candidacy and what impact could not that have on political polarization? beyond this election is the creation of a viable third party or centrist movement another possible solution to polarization? is polarization strictly a national problem? does the fact that we see more bipartisanship in state government offer hope that polarization in washington will begin to soften? on what issues are americans and their elected representatives actually not polarized? what are the remaining areas of consensus? maybe there is an answer we haven t considered yet drop your thoughts into an email to hello@theatlanticcom.,REAL

anne kim a policy editor at washington monthly and a senior fellow at the progressive policy institute has proposed a new way to help fight polarization of congress in an essay published in the winter 2016 issue of democracy kim calls for the creation of one at large congressional seat in every state chosen by voters statewide we currently determine our house seats by slicing up a states map into a bunch of different smaller segments except for states with very small populations that only get one at large representative under kims plan every state with more than two representatives would get an at large house member someone who would be accountable to the whole state rather than a narrow sliver of it voxs matthew yglesias has already advanced the idea of using at large districts to reduce polarization these plans envision treating the representatives as one at large group to be doled out proportionately after a statewide vote kims proposal is more modest and perhaps more practical by only asking for states to add one at large seat the plan preserves the benefits of the basic idea without requiring a wholesale transformation of how we conduct congressional elections federal and state law would have to be changed to make it possible but doing so kim says would likely create several dozen house seats that are by definition not gerrymandered and as a result are more responsive to the actual demands of their constituents this seems like a simple and easy to understand mechanism to get moderate americans a little more excited about a way for their voices to actually be heard kim says voters across a state are significantly more moderate than those in a gerrymandered district having a bloc of house members picked through statewide elections kim says would make it at least more likely that there is an institutional incentive for politicians to move to the center the creation of new plurality moderate at large seats in many states would increase the number of competitive seats while bolstering the odds for moderate candidates kim writes in her democracy essay challenging the status quo might be an excellent and concrete opportunity to test moderate muscle there is also precedent for these kinds of seats before 1967 at large districts existed in southern states as a way to prevent african americans from getting elected to congress but that doesn t mean they couldn t be brought back now to serve a new purpose kim says it would take an act of congress and thus a rare moment of bipartisan consensus for the plan to be enacted but in our interview kim argued that her plan could not help an embattled republican leadership that wants to regain control of a nomination process increasingly ceded to hardcore conservatives it is a way to defang the tea party i m not sure the republican party has gotten any favors by allowing that wing of the party to get as powerful as it has been kim says she added if the republican party has learned anything about reasserting the power of the establishment this is certainly the way to do it because it would give republican party moderates a voice the idea sounds interesting but it is unclear if at large house members would reduce political polarization even if it were somehow implemented according to experts interviewed for this story i think most political scientists would tell you that this is a nonstarter for one thing we already have 50 at large districts states and the senate is just as polarized as the house said morris fiorina a political science professor at stanford university who has done extensive research on polarization american politics is moving inexorably to the margins and even in a statewide vote the candidate will have to win a primary fiorina noted in other words there is just not much reason to believe gerrymandering is the main culprit here single member or at large safe district or competitive the candidate has to win a primary dominated by the wingnuts fiorina said matthew dickinson a professor of political science at middlebury college had a more measured response to the idea he too noted that the senate is highly polarized and questioned the premise that gerrymandering was the key contributing factor to the rise of extremism in congress it is an interesting proposition dickinson said of kims proposal but i suspect it will have less of an impact in reducing polarization than the author thinks but dickinson raised a possible counterargument to the counterargument yes the senate is very polarized but is the senate polarized at least in part because the house is? dickinson pointed to an academic paper from 2011 that argued this point noting that many of the highly partisan senators of today began as highly partisan members of the house the polarization in the house has directly contributed to polarization in the senate write sean m theriault of the university of texas austin and david rohde of duke university in addition kim the author of the democracy piece also pushed back on the idea that the senate and the house were equally driven by party factionalism the senate is polarized but it is not nearly as polarized as the house she said the most extreme member of the senate is not as extreme as the most extreme member of the house kim also acknowledged that the plan would not represent a silver bullet for the problem but with democrats and republicans in congress moving further apart than ever before she said it seems worth trying.,REAL

1601,kent ohio (cnn) hillary clintons campaign is insisting it can t be thrown off course in the final week of the presidential race because it is already running on auto pilot over the past 18 months the democratic nominee has built an impressive campaign infrastructure that has dwarfed her republican party opponent donald trump on fundraising and get out the vote efforts the sudden revival of clintons private email server as a top campaign issue is emerging as the ultimate test of whether all that work will pay off next week and whether her core message that she is the only candidate fit to be president will resonate fbi director james comey blindsided the clinton campaign friday by telling lawmakers newly discovered emails could not be pertinent to the probe into the private server the clinton campaign and her surrogates are furious that the announcement came so close to the election while trump and his allies are celebrating the fresh ammunition after spending weeks on defense campaigning in kent ohio on monday clinton brushed away the investigation saying voters have already made up their minds on the email issue i think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all this clinton said now what people are focused on is choosing the next president and commander and chief of the united states of america if the trump campaign has run a thoroughly unconventional campaign with little care for the traditional rules of politics and relatively bare bones infrastructure the clinton operation has devoted much of its time and resources to building out a robust ground game across battleground states in the final weeks clinton has particularly touted her campaigns get out the vote and early voting campaigns enlisting help from high profile celebrities like jennifer lopez march anthony katy perry and jay z the campaign is hopeful that these efforts will be crucial to driving up turnout on and before election day clinton aides cite early voting statistics as proof that while the fbi news has drawn heavy scrutiny in recent days it has not moved the core of her support early voting data show that over 35 million people have already voted in florida making up nearly one quarter of all registered voters in the state with democrats outpacing 2012 vote by mail numbers similarly in nevada where nearly one fourth of registered voters have already cast their ballot democrats are outpacing republicans by nearly 30 000 and clinton aides say the core of their base especially hispanic voters have already turned out to vote in high numbers citing trends in colorado nevada and florida some top advisers believe states with robust early voting and absentee balloting like nevada could not essentially be decided before election day still the campaign is on the lookout for any signs of damage from comeys announcement in some swing states aides acknowledge that the fbis renewed probe appears to have created some volatility with voters there is anecdotal evidence for example of clinton volunteers fielding questions about the fbis investigation while door knocking over the weekend on the flip side the campaign has also seen evidence of democrats who are now more eager to vote for clinton as a way to rebuke the fbi since friday clinton and her aides have been adamant comeys action is unprecedented this close to an election and there is nothing to new to be discovered on saturday in florida clinton called his announcement pretty strange in fact it is not just strange it is unprecedented and it is deeply troubling she said at a daytona beach rally and on monday clinton said at two ohio rallies that while she regrets using a private server the fbi simply has no case her aides are also continuing to pressure comey top campaign officials held a press call on monday in the wake of reports that the fbi director chose not to publicly comment on the trump campaigns potential ties to alleged efforts by russia to meddle with the us election campaign manager robby mook called the revelation a blatant double standard trump meanwhile is lauding comey and his announcement as often as he can it took a lot of guts for comey to reopen the investigation trump said monday in michigan where he was reaching for votes in the traditionally blue state i really disagreed with him i was not his fan but i ll tell you what what he did he brought back his reputation and while trump has been criticized for frequently veering off message and at times missing opportunities to seize on his opponents vulnerabilities clinton has stuck to a consistent theme when it comes to trump since the beginning of the general election the democratic nominee has relentlessly hit trumps temperament and readiness to be president through ads and speeches this calculation was made as soon as it was clear that trump would be the republican party nominee and a week before voters go to the polls clinton aides are confident that voters have had plenty of time to digest the contrasting choice that they ve presented in the election clinton continued that attack line on monday in ohio questioning the businessmans qualifications

of the final debates before the feb 1 iowa caucuses contained old and new claims alike • sen ted cruz who was born in canada said the law was “quite clear that the “child of a us citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen and therefore eligible to be president legal consensus is on his side but the issue isn t settled and could not require a supreme court ruling • sen marco rubio and cruz disagreed over whether cruzs tax plan which relies on a 16% tax on businesses was a “value added tax or vat as rubio said rubio is correct • new jersey gov chris christie repeated his claim that he “didn t support supreme court justice sonia sotomayor but in 2009 he said “i support her appointment and he urged the senate to confirm her while saying he wouldn t have nominated her • businessman donald trump described the syrian refugees as mostly “strong powerful men but most of the more than 46 million refugees registered with the united nations are women and children • cruz repeated his claim that the senate immigration bill that rubio cosponsored would have given the president power to admit syrian refugees “without mandating meaningful background checks the bill would have made it easier for members of certain groups to qualify as refugees but they would still be subject to background checks • sen marco rubio claimed that cruz flipped positions on his support for legalization of immigrants currently living in the us illegally but that depends on whether or not cruz was bluffing back in 2013 when he proposed an amendment that would have allowed legalization • christie also repeated his claim that “we double tax us companies with overseas operations the us tax code provides a foreign tax credit to avoid that • christie rubio and ohio gov john kasich all said that the us has the highest corporate tax rate in the world it is the highest statutory tax rate among industrialized nations but not the highest marginal effective tax rate according to one analysis • in the earlier debate former pennsylvania senator rick santorum claimed 2 million manufacturing jobs had been lost under obama the number is actually 230 000 jobs lost • businesswoman carly fiorina said of the september 2012 benghazi attacks “[w]hen you do not say the united states of america will retaliate for that attack terrorists assume it is open season the president repeatedly vowed to bring the killers to justice seven republican party candidates met on the main stage on jan 14 businessman donald trump retired neurosurgeon ben carson sen marco rubio former florida governor jeb bush sen ted cruz ohio gov john kasich and new jersey gov chris christie the earlier undercard debate included former pennsylvania senator rick santorum businesswoman carly fiorina and former arkansas governor mike huckabee the debate aired on fox business network and was held in north charleston sc asked about trump questioning whether cruz qualifies as a “natural born citizen eligible to serve as president cruz said “the facts and the law here are really quite clear under longstanding us law the child of a us citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen when we wrote about the issue in march we concluded that the legal consensus was on cruzs side but the issue isn t as settled as cruz makes out the constitution does not define “natural born and the supreme court has not ruled on its precise meaning and there are at least some constitutional scholars who believe cruz is ineligible trump said he is convinced that if cruz wins the republican nomination “i already know the democrats are going to be bringing a suit you have a big lawsuit over your head while you re running and if you become the nominee who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? so you should go out get a declaratory judgment let the courts decide cruzs birth certificate shows he was born in calgary alberta on dec 22 1970 to an american mother and cuban father cruz who came to the us at age 4 is a citizen by birth because his mother was a us citizen when he was born but the us constitution requires a president to be not just a citizen but a “natural born citizen in 2013 sarah helene duggin a catholic university law professor wrote “there is a strong argument that anyone who acquires united states citizenship at birth whether by virtue of the 14th amendment or by operation of federal statute qualifies as natural born and neal katyal and paul clement two former us solicitors general writing for the harvard law review said that cruz qualifies as a “natural born citizen but there are other legal scholars who disagree earlier this week thewashington post published an opinion piece by march brigid mcmanamon a constitutional law professor at widener universitys delaware law school in which she made the argument that cruz is not eligible to be president during the debate trump repeatedly referred to another legal scholar laurence tribe a constitutional law professor at harvard who once had cruz as a student in an opinion piece penned for the boston globe on jan 11 tribe opined that while “no real court is likely to keep cruz off the ballot much less remove him from the white house if he were to win the kind of “originalist judges that cruz has said he would appoint to the supreme court are the very ones most likely to conclude he is ineligible cruz described tribe as “a left wing judicial activist harvard law professor who was al gores lawyer in bush versus gore hes a major hillary clinton supporter tribe once argued on al gores behalf at the supreme court about the results of the 2000 presidential election according to cnn tribe is “certainly a voice in liberal politics though not at least not yet a formal backer of clinton but tribe didn t say he thinks cruz is ineligible only that he thinks cruz is “a fair weather originalist when it comes to interpreting the constitutions definition of “natural born cruz said that “under longstanding us law the child of a us citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen ultimately the issue might have to go to the supreme court as we wrote in march even duggin who wrote in her 2013 article that “[a] scholarly consensus is emerging … that anyone who acquires citizenship at birth is natural born for purposes of article ii acknowledged that the issue may not be settled “in the absence of a definitive supreme court ruling or a constitutional amendment the parameters of the clause remain uncertain she wrote rubio and cruz tangled on the texans tax plan which relies on a 16% tax to be paid by businesses rubio said cruz was proposing a “value added tax or vat of the kind ronald reagan opposed cruz responded by denying that he was proposing a vat as a practical matter we find rubio was correct and cruz misled when he denied that his proposal amounted to a vat don t take our word for it the nonpartisan business funded tax foundation has described the cruz proposal as a “subtraction method value added tax and the conservative national review also describes it as a vat period what cruz proposes is to eliminate both the corporate income tax (which falls on net profits) and the payroll tax substituting a 16% tax on businesses “on revenues minus expenses such as equipment computers and other business investments not mentioned is that the cruz tax would fall on what businesses pay their employees and would tend to be passed along and paid by consumers in the form of higher prices cruz prefers to call his plan a “business flat tax but as the tax foundations analysis stated “its base is identical in economic terms to that of the credit invoice vat seen in many oecd countries [except that] it is calculated from corporate accounts not on individual transactions the tax foundation said its computer model predicts that the cruz plan would boost economic growth and wages over the long term but some conservatives worry that voters won t know how much they are paying “it is the hidden nature of this tax that has traditionally worried conservatives the national review wrote in a jan 13 editorial “most people would not know what their wages would have bought them if this tax were lower or if it did not exist it was that criticism that rubio echoed in his debate remarks cruz also exaggerated when he claimed that his tax plan had been called “the best by reagans “chief economic adviser it is true that economist arthur laffer coauthored a nov 20 investors business daily article naming the tax plans of cruz and the flat tax plan offered by kentucky sen rand paul as the “best tax proposals since paul was excluded from the fox business news debate he wasn t on the stage when cruz made his claim so cruz is technically accurate on that score however laffer was never reagans “chief economic adviser nor was he even a member of reagans white house council of economic advisers laffer was instead one of a dozen members of an “economic policy advisory board that reagan named soon after taking office and which was directed to meet “every 3 or 4 months and by the way even the laffer article flatly called the cruz plan a value added tax referring to “the cruz and paul vats christie repeated the claim that he “didn t support [supreme court justice] sonia sotomayor during the confirmation process in 2009 christie said he wouldn t have nominated sotomayor but that “i support her confirmation and he urged the senate to confirm her rubio brought up the subject saying that christie had supported sotomayors appointment this is the second time christie denied supporting her this week as we wrote he said on sundays face the nation that he “didn t voice support for sonia sotomayor his statement in 2009 when he was a candidate for governor in new jersey might have had a caveat but it certainly was support the website politickernj carried christies statement at the time which said “after watching and listening to judge sotomayors performance at the confirmation hearings this week i am confident that she is qualified for the position of associate justice of the us supreme court … while judge sotomayor would not have been my choice president obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the supreme court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability competence and ability i support her appointment to the supreme court and urge the senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination christie and rubio also disagreed over whether christie had ever given a donation to planned parenthood we can t say whether christie did or didn t christie was quoted in the newark star ledger in 1994 as saying he did support the nonprofit “privately with my personal contribution he now says he was misquoted the 1994 story was written by brian t murray who is currently the governors spokesman at the time christie was a candidate for a county freeholder seat and said he was opposed to restoring funding to planned parenthood “i support planned parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency to find private donations he was quoted as saying christies campaign told us there is no record of such a donation but there wouldn t be one since nonprofits are not required to disclose donations he toldthewashington post on jan 12 that he was “convinced the 22 year old comment “was a misquote trump painted a distorted picture of the demographics of the syrian refugees as mostly “strong powerful men trump was asked about president obama pointing during his state of the union address to a syrian refugee now living near detroit a man with a doctorate degree whose wife and daughter were killed by a syrian government anti personnel missile “when i look at the migration i looked at the line … where are the women? it looked like very few women very few children trump responded “strong powerful men young and people are looking at that and they re saying whats going on? as we have writtenbefore most of the more than 46 million syrian refugees registered with the united nations are women and children according to the un as of dec 31 about half of them (507%) are women another 20% are males under the age of 12 just 214% are males age 18 to 59 in november when we asked the administration for a demographic breakdown of syrian refugees who are seeking to resettle in the us it provided a chart that shows 23 826 total applicants 15 937 or 67% of whom are women (of all ages) and male children (age 0 to 11) men (age 18 and older) accounted for 255% that closely mirrors the demographic breakdown of the syrian refugee population at large cruz said that the senate immigration bill that rubio cosponsored “expanded barack obamas power to let in syrian refugees … without mandating meaningful background checks the bills 744 would have made it easier for members of certain groups designated by the president to qualify as refugees but they would still be subject to the same required screening process as other refugees before they could not come to the us the bill which was also cosponsored by democratic sen charles schumer did not specifically mention refugees from syria section 3403 authorized the president to declare certain groups with common characteristics as refugees for special humanitarian purposes in order to qualify for refugee status individuals would only have to prove that they were a member of the refugee group designated by the president that differs from current law which says that individuals applying to come to the us as refugees must demonstrate that they can t or won t return to their home country because of “persecution or a well founded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion so in theory the president could not declare syrians as a special group eligible for admission to the us as refugees however they would still have to undergo the same security screening process as all other individuals applying to come to the us as refugees that includes a background check whether cruz thinks it is “meaningful or not “even if they somehow were found to fit the criteria as laid out (including having a specific vulnerability justified in the national interest etc) and be designated as a group they would still need to go through all of the same security vetting as other refugees said joanne kelsey assistant director for advocacy with the lutheran immigration and refugee service in an email to factcheckorg rubio revived an attack line from the last republican debate claiming that cruz flipped positions on his support for legalization of immigrants currently living in the us illegally but as we wrote before whether thats true depends on whether one believes cruz was bluffing back in 2013 when he proposed an amendment that would have allowed legalization rubio addressed cruz during the most recent debate saying “you used to support legalizing people that were here illegally now you say you re against it during the december debate cruz said unequivocally “i have never supported legalization and i do not intend to support legalization but rubio contends that he did in the midst of a contentious senate battle over comprehensive immigration legislation back in 2013 in 2013 cruz offered an amendment to a senate immigration bill that would have stripped out a proposal for a path to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally but cruzs amendment would have purposefully left intact the bills provisions to provide legal status for them numerous media outlets described cruzs plan as a compromise “middle road in the immigration debate that he hoped might be palatable to enough legislators in both houses of congress to actually pass cruz publicly opposeds 744 the border security economic opportunity and immigration modernization act because it provided a “path to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally cruz labeled it an “amnesty bill and he criticized rubio for cosponsoring it although cruz made numerous statements at the time in support of his amendment cruzs campaign told us the amendment was a ploy to expose the real motivations of the bills supporters while those supporters claimed the bills aim was to allow 11 million immigrants in the country illegally to come out of the shadows the cruz campaign says cruz was convinced the actual intent was to provide citizenship to those immigrants so they could not become future voters so the campaign says cruz offered the amendment knowing it would not pass to show the real priority of supporters even if the amendment had been accepted cruz still would not have supported the bill the campaign says because he opposes legalization as we said in december we ll leave it up to readers to decide whether cruz once supported legalization as a political compromise and now disavows it or whether he was merely employing a legislative ploy to expose the motivations of his opponents christie was wrong when he claimed “we double tax us companies with overseas operations the fact is the us tax code provides a foreign tax credit to avoid exactly what christie claimed is happening the us statutory corporate tax rate is 35% as christie said and the us has what is known as a “worldwide approach which as explained by the congressional budget office taxes all income “regardless of where that income is earned but as the cbo says the us typically provides a foreign tax credit “to avoid taxing income twice the foreign tax credit is subtracted from taxes that would otherwise be owed on line 5a of the corporate tax return form 1120 irs instructions define taxes eligible for a credit as those “paid or accrued during the tax year to any foreign country or us possession “this results in their paying tax at the us rate not double taxation eric toder a co director of the nonpartisan tax policy center who was the director of research at the irs from 2001 to 2004 told us when we first wrote about this in june christie rubio and kasich all said that the us has the highest corporate or business tax rate in the world the highest statutory tax rate among industrialized nations yes but perhaps not the highest marginal effective tax rate according to one analysis neither christie kasich or rubio specified which corporate tax rate they were talking about there are different measurements the us has the highest statutory rate 391% among the 34 industrialized nations in the organisation for economic co operation and development according to the nonpartisan pro business tax foundation the nonpartisan tax policy center defines the statutory rate as the “rate that is imposed on taxable income of corporations which is equal to corporate receipts less deductions for labor costs materials and depreciation of capital assets chad (40%) and the united arab emirates (55%) two non oecd member nations actually have higher rates than the us according to the tax foundation but the tax policy center says that the marginal effective tax rate which assesses how much the corporate tax reduces the rate of return on new investment “is consequently the best measure of how taxes affect a firms incentive to invest and the us marginal effective tax rate is 353% according to the most recent tax foundation analysis that is second to frances rate of 36% among oecd nations and it puts the us in sixth place behind argentina (435%) chad (372%) uzbekistan (371%) colombia (366%) and france among 95 nations reviewed for the tax foundation study in the earlier debate former pennsylvania senator rick santorum claimed that the us has lost 2 million manufacturing jobs under president obama thats way off the net loss of manufacturing jobs as of december was 230 000 santorum twice used the 2 million figure including a second time when challenged by debate moderator sandra smith as we said in our story on obamas state of the union address obama was largely correct in saying the us has created nearly 900 000 jobs in the last six years but that ignores the earlier job losses during his time in office there has been a net loss of 230 000 over the entire seven years of his presidency dropping from 12 561 000 jobs in january 2009 to 12 331 000 in december 2015 according to the bureau of labor statistics but santorums numbers don t add up at all at its lowest point the number of manufacturing jobs under obama stood at 11 453 000 in february 2010 11 million off the peak in january 2009 thats nearly half as many as santorum claimed and most but not all of those jobs have been recovered also in the undercard debate fiorina criticized the obama administrations response to the attacks on a us diplomatic facility in benghazi that resulted in four deaths including that of us ambassador christopher stevens “[w]hen you do not say the united states of america will retaliate for that attack terrorists assume it is open season fiorina said the fact is the president repeatedly vowed to bring the killers to justice in a rose garden speech on the morning after the sept 11 2012 attack “and make no mistake we will work with the libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people obama said at one point later in his speech he also said “we will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act and make no mistake justice will be done similarly that same day secretary of state hillary clinton spoke at the state department and vowed that the us would not “rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice two days later obama spoke at a ceremony at andrews air force base when the remains of the benghazi victims were returned to the us in that speech obama said “to you their families and colleagues to all americans know this their sacrifice will never be forgotten we will bring to justice those who took them from us for a full list of sources see factcheckorg.,REAL

507,did italian prime minister matteo renzi actually read the full text of the unesco resolution on palestine and israel before he raved with anger? “i think this is a mistaken inconceivable resolution he said “it is not possible to continue with these resolutions at the un and unesco that aim to attack israel it is shocking and i have ordered that we stop taking this position (his countrys abstention) even if it means diverging from the position taken by the rest of europe he added renzi who became prime minister in 2014 at the relatively young age of 39 knows exactly how the game is played in order to win favor with washington he must first please tel aviv his country has abstained from the october 12 vote on a resolution that condemns israels violations of the cultural and legal status of occupied east jerusalem this decision has ignited the ire of israeli ambassador to rome ofer zaks who riled up the jewish community in italy to protest the abstention renzi in turn was converted into a champion of the temple mount the name israel uses to describe the palestinian muslim holy site renzi cravenly went on damage control mode without truly understanding the nature of the resolution which merely condemned israels obvious violations of international law and only calls for israel to respect the status of palestinian culture in the occupied city none of procedures that led to the vote on the unescos resolution voted by 24 6 with 26 abstentions violated protocol nor was any of the wording inconsistent with international law in fact unesco was merely doing its job attempting to protect and preserve the historical and cultural heritage of the world jerusalem is a sacred and a holy city to a majority of humanity simply because it is significant to the spiritual wellbeing of the adherents of the three monotheistic religions in fact the resolution stated so “affirming the importance of the old city of jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions … renzis outburst is quite disappointing to say the least for the young eager politician simply tried to score cheap political points with israel thus the united states without a full or even partial comprehension of what the unesco resolution resolved nor did he seem aware of the fact that such text is largely a repeat of what has been discussed by the worlds leading cultural organization in april and repeatedly before that date “if anyone wants to say something about israel let them say it but they should not use unesco… to say that the jews have no links to jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness he said paraphrasing the sentiment displayed by the israeli prime minister it would be rather sad if renzi sees a mentor in benjamin netanyahu for the latter is one of the least liked world leaders who has made a mockery of international forums and derided the united nations itself as anti semitic and its process as theater of the absurd this is what netanyahu had said in response to the resolution and shortly before he suspended his countrys membership in unesco using a language that is as amusing as his cartoon depiction of the iranian nuclear bomb in his famous un spectacle in 2012 he said “to say that israel has no connection to the temple mount and the western wall is like saying that china has no connection to the great wall of china or that egypt has no connection to the pyramids other israeli officials followed suit with a chorus of denunciations included israeli president reuven rivilin who described the decision as an “embarrassment for unesco culture minister miri regev cut to the chase by labeling the resolution “shameful and anti semitic in fact it was neither in addition to renzis odd reaction the united states and other western governments reacted with exaggerated anger again without even addressing the situation on the ground which prompted the resolution and numerous other un resolutions in the past in the first place even the czech parliament jumped on board voting to condemn what they described as a “hateful anti israel sentiment i have read the resolution repeatedly to pinpoint the specific text that could not possibly be understood by israels friends as hateful to no avail the entirety of the text was based on past international conventions resolutions international law and refers to israel as the occupying power as per the diktat of the geneva conventions the italian czech american anger is of course misdirected and is largely political theater but of course there is an important context that they refuse to address israel is working diligently to appropriate muslim and christian heritage in east jerusalem a city that is designated by international law as illegally occupied the israeli army and police have restricted the movement of palestinian worshipers and is excavating under the foundation of the third holiest muslim shrine haram al sharif in search of a mythological temple in the process of doing so numerous palestinians trying to defend their mosque from the attacks staged by israeli occupation forces and extremist jewish groups have been killed how is unesco to react to this? the resolution merely called on israel to “allow for the restoration of the historic status quo that prevailed until september 2000 under which the jordanian awqaf (religious foundation) department exercised exclusive authority on al aqṣa mosque/al ḥaram al sharif moreover it stressed the “urgent need of the implementation of the unesco reactive monitoring mission to the old city of jerusalem and its walls where is the hate and anti semitism in that? israels anger is of course fathomable for nearly fifty years following the illegal occupation and annexation of the palestinian arab city israel has done everything it could not possibly do to strip the city of its universal appeal and arab heritage and make it exclusive to jews only thus the slogan of jerusalem being israels eternal and undivided capital israel is angry because after five decades of ceaseless efforts neither unesco nor other un institutions will accept israels practices and designations in 2011 following the admission of palestine as a member state israel ranted and raved as well resulting in the us cutting off funding to unesco the latest resolution indicates that israel and the us have utterly failed to coerce unesco what also caused much fury in tel aviv is that unesco used the arabic references to haram al sharif al aqsa mosque and other muslim religious and heritage sites the same way they would refer to egypts pyramids of giza and chinas great wall by their actual names hardly anti semitic since its establishment atop palestinian towns and village israel has been on a mission to rename everything arabic with hebrew alternatives recent years have seen a massive push towards the judaization of arab christian and muslim sites streets and holy shrines a campaign spearheaded by the israeli right and ultranationalist groups to expect unesco to employ such language is what should strike as absurd not only should the unesco resolution be respected it should also be followed by practical mechanisms to implement its recommendations israel an occupying power should not be given a free pass to besiege the holy shrines of two major world religions restrict the movement and attack worshipers annex occupied territories and destroy what is essential spiritual heritage that belongs to the whole world join the debate on facebook dr ramzy baroud has been writing
