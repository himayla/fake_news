377,democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton faces a striking choice in the final three weeks of the campaign to expand her efforts to states that democrats haven t won in a generation or to stay a current course that if conditions hold would deliver her a resounding electoral college victory after two tumultuous weeks focused on donald trumps behavior toward women clinton is ahead in nearly all of the key battleground states where her campaign has directed the most resources according to many recent polls but some once solidly republican states notably arizona georgia and utah now also appear to be in play clinton aides said they see advantages to running up the score in the electoral college where 270 votes wins the white house victories in unexpected places could not boost that total handing her more of a mandate come january and decreasing the potency of trumps complaints of a “rigged election but victories in core battleground states such as pennsylvania and new hampshire would almost assuredly cut off trumps path as well those states are also home to key down ballot races that will determine control of the senate an important factor in how much support clinton would have while launching an agenda in january “it is true more and more states are emerging as truly competitive clinton spokesman brian fallon said “we are closely following the situations in those states even as we refuse to take anything for granted in the core battlegrounds which also happen to be the sites of some of the biggest senate races the issue is predominantly about resources clinton and the democratic party entered october with twice as much money in the bank as trump and the republicans but some in clintons camp have cautioned against any late moves that could not jeopardize a victory in states she appears to have nailed down “we ve got to get our win said a senior clinton aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the campaigns strategy “we have to make sure we focus on keeping the pressure on and doing the things we need to build up as many electoral votes as we can the campaign is expected to decide in the coming days whether to make a more aggressive play for states such as georgia which is being eyed as one of the more promising opportunities for clinton and arizona where a couple of high profile surrogates are being deployed this week sen bernie sanders (vt) on tuesday and chelsea clinton on wednesday meanwhile the trump campaign is not willing to concede publicly that any states on the map are lost maintaining that clintons low favorability ratings and trumps anti establishment message will push undecided voters and independents to break for trump in the final leg of the campaign “we are seeing a much more competitive contest than you re analyzing them to be we are still playing a very active role in these states and obviously making as big of a play as possible said trump spokesman jason miller “there isn t anything thats not a priority we don t want to isolate it and say everything comes down to these states added trump campaign manager kellyanne conway “every time they get overconfident we snap back conway said there may be a need to reallocate resources in the remaining weeks but she noted that it is “a little premature to announce when or where that might happen “there is no shame in saying we are going to reallocate our resources dollars personnel data operation ground game candidate time both [indiana gov mike] pences and trumps time in places where we are more competitive she said the shifting poll numbers come amid the nastiest stretch of this years campaign in which a videotape emerged showing trump bragging in lewd terms about forcing himself on women sexually following the videos publication in the washington post on oct 7 multiple women have accused trump of kissing or groping them without their consent [the growing list of women who have stepped forward to accuse trump of touching them inappropriately] both trump and his running mate pence have hinted that they recognize the shift trump has stepped up his disparagement of a “rigged election at campaign stops across the country and on social media urging his supporters to monitor polling places closely on nov 8 on sunday trump noted on twitter that there are national polls showing him within striking distance of clinton despite the intense media focus on the accusations against him “polls close but can you believe i lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events that never happened media rigging election! trump tweeted pence sought to play down trumps rhetoric saying “we will absolutely accept the result of the election during an appearance sunday on nbcs “meet the press but he also appeared to embrace at least partly the notion of a “rigged election “the american people are tired of the obvious bias in the national media pence said “thats where the sense of a rigged election goes here even as some polls have shown clinton with only a modest lead nationally one published sunday by the washington post had her up four points over trump her advantage on the electoral map appears sizable [clinton holds four point lead in aftermath of release of trump tape] one such tally maintained by the posts blog the fix projects that clinton would win 341 electoral votes to trumps 197 if the election were held today [the 2016 electoral map is collapsing around donald trump] several states that trump initially sought to contest including colorado and virginia have now seemingly slipped out of reach clinton was up by 15 points in virginia according to a poll released sunday by the wason center for public policy at christopher newport university and trump has pulled resources from virginia trumps failure to perform in such states clinton aides said will allow her campaign to shift attention even more to north carolina and florida two must win states for trump to choke his path to 270 electoral votes clinton is running television ads tailored to seven states pennsylvania new hampshire florida north carolina nevada ohio and iowa because they cost millions of dollars to sustain such ad purchases are the clearest clue about which states are a campaigns top priority the vast majority of clintons campaign appearances and those of her running mate sen tim kaine of virginia have been concentrated in those states and most of the high profile surrogates dispatched by the campaign have focused their efforts there as well trumps campaign now appears intent on remaining competitive in four battleground states florida north carolina ohio and pennsylvania he has maintained a far busier travel schedule than clinton hitting all four of those states last week as well as new hampshire and maine trump appeared in florida on three consecutive days last week underscoring how crucial the state is to his strategy trump will spend the early part of this week in wisconsin and colorado before heading to nevada for wednesdays debate his campaign operations in key battlegrounds continue to suffer from ongoing tensions with both state and national republican party establishments and a dearth of on the ground investments last week the campaign fired trumps state co chairman in virginia corey stewart after he took part in a protest against the republican national committee in ohio where trump has fallen behind in the polls the campaign severed ties with matt borges the chairman of the state republican party in a scathing letter trumps ohio state director robert paduchik accused borges of going on a “self promotional media tour with state and national outlets to criticize our partys nominee while the clinton campaign has begun exploring new opportunities it has also redoubled its efforts in some of its strongest states the campaign increased investments recently in new hampshire pennsylvania and nevada according to a democrat who was familiar with the strategy but was not authorized to speak publicly the planned visits to arizona this week by sanders and chelsea clinton meanwhile march what some democrats see as a longer term shift in the states electoral politics only one democrat bill clinton has carried arizona since 1948 bill clinton lost the state in 1992 but narrowly prevailed in 1996 alexis tameron the states democratic party chairwoman said the demographics of the state are trending in the right direction for democrats and the states voting patterns could not resemble colorado within a few cycles even as it weighs whether to invest heavily in new states the clinton campaign is increasingly reaching out to voters in those places through local media an effort to maintain a presence without reallocating resources to the state kaine spoke to a salt lake city television station remotely from new york on thursday relaying that the clinton campaign wants to step up its focus on the state which democrats have not won since 1964 “hopefully we ll even have candidates or spouses or high profile surrogates visit kaine told ktvx “we are 3 1/2 weeks out in a state that we didn t think was in play now it is in georgia where the last democrat to carry the state was bill clinton in 1992 there is a clear sense that the contest is more meaningful than in recent cycles said michael smith communications director for the georgia democratic party “instead of using georgia to mobilize people to go to north carolina they re staying in our state it is night and day smith said democrats are running coordinated campaigns in the battleground states meaning money is being to spent to promote the entire ticket not just clinton that stands to benefit democratic senate candidates including katie mcginty in pennsylvania maggie hassan in new hampshire deborah ross in north carolina and catherine cortez masto in nevada all of whom are in competitive races priorities usa action the pro clinton super pac is considering devoting television air time to senate races in four states nevada new hampshire north carolina and pennsylvania according to a person familiar with the discussions a decision is expected to be made by the middle of the week in an effort to help down ballot candidates across the country clinton and her surrogates especially president obama have stepped up their case against

step one is as simple as recognizing that you are operating from a state of overwhelm self awareness breaks us out of unconscious patterning and this is central to the practice of mindfulness learning to check in with ones self by pausing is also a great way to develop emotional intelligence step two is to take a few deep breathes after recognizing that you are overwhelmed this also works if you are angry sad or reacting out of fear since the emotional response is rooted in the right hemisphere it always feels immediate by breathing you are helping your mind integrate the threat level into time synchronisation which is a left brain process that will help relax your nervous system step three is to remind yourself that you are safe and to develop strategies to call on this sense of safety when needed this is known as resourcing ones self and there are healthy ways of doing it as well as unhealthy ways hint reaching for a cigarette or indulging in television drugs or june food is not as effective as 5 minutes of stretching mindful breathing or taking a moment to connect with nature step four is to help your body let go of any stress hormones that may have been released into your system at the first moment of panic/overwhelm shake like a dog jump up and down or do some psoas stretches to discharge the nervous system and help you reset your physical body as well as your emotional body self awareness breaks us out of unconscious patterning overwhelm has a whole lot to do with our perceptions we expand our mental emotional container to be able to integrate larger and larger amounts of information without succumbing to overwhelm in the first place the steps above will help you deal with overwhelm when it hits you but a daily mindfulness practice will help you reduce the instances when you are thrown into overwhelm the ability to respond without reacting to observe without indulging will help you increase success in your life on many levels it will also be a valuable skill in rapidly changing times! jacob devaney founder and director of culture collective creative activist musician and producer 0 ·.,FAKE

you re right to the confusion of a diehard band of bernie sanders supporters in luminous t shirts who sought to disrupt the speech they were forced instead to pause and even once or twice applaud when clinton presented an unashamedly liberal and populist vision of america “if you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deals that we should stand up to china that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers join us said clinton in clear appeal to both right and left incarnations of the pitchfork outbreak sweeping the country in this election cycle “whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these beliefs this is your campaign she added promising she would be a president for all americans whether they voted for her or not but taking trumps appeal seriously was not the same as taking trump seriously an increasingly confident clinton was merciless in skewering the celebrity billionaire as a “little man “really? i alone can fix it? she asked at one point letting the questions hang there as a description of everything that is absurd about this close fought election race “he spoke for 70 odd minutes and i do mean odd she continued eliciting the kind of laughter that was bound to produce a reaction from the man himself and did “imagine him if you dare imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons anticipated clinton he might be a joke she said but his appeal was not “for the past year many people made the mistake of laughing off donald trumps comments excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show warned the former secretary of state “heres the sad truth there is no other donald trump this is it the laughs came naturally for a crowd that warmed to a rare display of comic timing from clinton “donald trump says he wants to make america great again well he could not start by actually making things in america again there was a little shake of the head as if to say “duh when she said “i believe in science and rejected the denial of climate change in another year of temperature records smashed she turned to another first lady jackie kennedy for the insult that may yet stick “she said that what worried president kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started not by big men with self control and restraint but by little men the ones moved by fear and pride over the course of the evening trump was called many names “a political pyromaniac said los angeles mayor eric garcetti who suggested trump should build his wall around the whole city “hillary clinton knows how to fight back against dangerous loudmouth bullies she doesn t run to twitter to give people badmouth nicknames said elizabeth warren who had been on the receiving end some of clintons own putdowns would end another campaign overnight but this is a teflon don seemingly able to say anything without consequence so clinton refused the temptation to indulge in excessive trump bashing preferring to paint her own vision there was plenty of policy a bold promise to introduce the biggest jobs program since the second world war in her first 100 days as president and invest money in infrastructure projects and political capital in gun control rejecting the dangerously persistent notion that she simply wanted to be president because it was her turn clinton also used much of the packed speech to describe her real motivation introduced by her daughter chelsea she continued the weeks highly personal theme by pinning this political philosophy on her own mother dorothy “she made sure i learned the words of our methodist faith said the nominee “do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can the moral vision continued to help defuse the still simmering revolt on the left where a rump of sanders supporters were largely drowned out in their attempt to disrupt the night “i want to thank bernie sanders said clinton “bernie your campaign inspired millions of americans particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary mostly she ignored disruptions that were more noticeable in the hall than on television by the end the chants were no longer papering over the cracks in the party but rolling expressions of real enthusiasm waving up and down the stadium the crowd had been fired up earlier in the evening by another speech that could not easily have been at home in a sanders rally “we are being called upon by our foremothers and fathers to be the moral defibrillator said rev william barber “we cannot give up on the heart of democracy not now not ever … we need to fight for the heart of this nation but it was the calm nobility of khizr khan whose son died serving the us military in iraq who summed up why clinton was really running accusing trump of “smearing the character of patriotic american muslims “donald trump let me ask you have you even read the us constitution? i will gladly lend you my copy look for the words liberty and equal protection under the law said khan instead clinton made clear she would be a “president for democrats republicans and independents “for the struggling the striving the successful for those who vote for me and those who don t whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these beliefs this is your campaign for all americans she said appealing to those reagan democrats of a different age clinton said of trump “hes taken the republican party a long way from morning in america to midnight in america “he wants us to fear the future and fear each other well a great democratic president franklin delano roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to trump more than 80 years ago during a much more perilous time the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.,REAL

2649,washington (reuters) us president donald trump ignited a political firestorm on tuesday by firing fbi director james comey who had been leading an investigation into the trump 2016 presidential campaigns possible collusion with russia to influence the election outcome read the latest on the comey firingdefending firing of fbi director trump derides democratic criticssenate republican leader opposed new russia investigationthe republican president said he fired comey the top us law enforcement official over his handling of an election year email scandal involving then democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton the move stunned washington and raised suspicions among democrats and others that the white house was trying to blunt the fbi probe involving russia some democrats compared trumps move to the “saturday night massacre of 1973 in which president richard nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the watergate scandal white house officials denied allegations that there was any political motive in the move by trump who took office on jan 20 senate democratic leader chuck schumer said he spoke to trump and told him he was “making a very big mistake in firing comey adding the president did not “really answer in response an independent investigation into moscows role in the election “is now the only way to go to restore the american peoples faith schumer said though many democrats have criticized comeys handling of the clinton email probe they said they were troubled by the timing of trumps firing of him senator richard burr the republican chairman of the senate intelligence committee which is overseeing its own investigation into russian interference during the election said in a statement he was also troubled by the timing of comeys termination “his dismissal i believe is a loss for the bureau and the nation burr said us intelligence agencies concluded in a january report that russian president vladimir putin had ordered an effort to disrupt the 2016 election with the aim of helping trump cnn reported on tuesday night that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury subpoenas to former trump national security adviser michael flynn seeking business records as part of the probe into russian interference in the election trumps firing of comey came a day after former acting attorney general sally yates told a senate panel that she had informed the white house on jan 26 that flynn was at risk of blackmail by moscow because he had been untruthful about his discussions with the russian ambassador sergei kislyak trump fired flynn 18 days later russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and the trump administration denies allegations of collusion with russia trump in a letter to comey released by the white house said “it is essential that we find new leadership for the fbi that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission the president told comey in the letter that he accepted the recommendation of attorney general jeff sessions that he could not no longer provide effective leadership comeys term was to run through september 2023 he was appointed director by democratic president barack obama in 2013 sessions advised trumps campaign before being picked by the president to lead the justice department sessions had recused himself from involvement in the russia investigation after he misstated his own 2016 contacts with russias ambassador to washington comeys deputy andrew mccabe became acting fbi director the white house said the search for a new permanent director would begin immediately pushing back against critics of the move white house officials said deputy attorney general rod rosenstein a career prosecutor who took office on april 25 assessed the situation at the fbi and concluded that comey had lost his confidence rosenstein senator his recommendation to sessions who concurred and they forwarded their recommendation to trump who accepted it on tuesday they said the white house released a memo in which rosenstein wrote “i cannot defend the directors handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary clintons emails and i do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken rosenstein cited several former justice department officials comments criticizing comeys handling of the clinton email investigation including his public statements but one of those he cited donald ayer a former deputy attorney general under president hw bush questioned the purported reasons for the firing reached by reuters ayer said in an email that the administrations explanation was “a sham comey was traveling in los angeles when the news broke that he had been fired in an odd twist a white house official said the letter firing him was delivered to the fbi by keith schiller trumps longtime armed personal bodyguard who is now director of oval office operations at the white house trump in the letter said “while i greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that i am not under investigation i nevertheless concur with the judgment of the department of justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau comey 56 had been the target of criticism from many quarters for his handling of a probe involving clintons use of a private email server while she was us secretary of state under obama as recently as tuesday the fbi clarified remarks that comey made on the matter last week trump had originally criticized the fbi director for not pursuing criminal charges against clinton last july but later lavished praise on him comey had said in july the clinton email case should be closed without prosecution but then declared 11 days before the nov 8 election that he had reopened the investigation because of a discovery of a new trove of clinton related emails clinton and other democrats say they believe comeys decision help cost her the election the firing came as a shock to fbi staff nearly all of whom had confidence in comey despite the controversy surrounding his handling of the clinton email situation according to an fbi official who spoke on condition of anonymity the official said there was concern among agents that the firing was a political act related to the russian investigation other current and former us intelligence and law enforcement officials questioned the white house explanation for comeys firing “trump praised him for the work on the email investigation so thats not it said austin berglas a former fbi supervisory agent on hacking cases “i think he realized the extent of the russia investigation under way and moved him out to me thats the only logical explanation right now trumps dismissal of comey does not mean the fbis investigation into russias interference in the us presidential election will be disrupted or end career fbi staffers can continue the probe even as the search for a new fbi director begins legal experts said republican representative justin amash wrote on twitter that he and his staff were reviewing the possibility of drafting legislation to create an independent commission to look into the russian campaign meddling legislation related to the appointment of a special prosecutor or independent counsel has lapsed but justice department regulations provide for

2899,nairobi (reuters) the united states is suspending food and fuel aid for most of somalias armed forces over corruption concerns a blow to the military as african peacekeepers start to withdraw this month african union (au) troops landed in mogadishu a decade ago to fight al shabaab islamist militants and somali forces are supposed to eventually take over their duties but the united states which also funds the 22 000 strong peacekeeping force has grown frustrated that successive governments have failed to build a viable national army diplomats worry that without strong somali forces al shabaab could not be reinvigorated destabilize the region and offer a safe haven to other al qaeda linked militants or islamic state fighters the us suspension of aid came after the somali military repeatedly failed to account for food and fuel according to private correspondence between the us and somali governments seen by reuters during recent discussions between the united states and the federal government of somalia both sides agreed that the somali national army had failed to meet the standards for accountability for us assistance a state department official told reuters last week on condition of anonymity we are adjusting us assistance to sna units with the exception of units receiving some form of mentorship to ensure that us assistance is being used effectively and for its intended purpose the official said the us suspension comes at a sensitive time the au force with troops from burundi djibouti ethiopia kenya and uganda is scheduled to leave by 2020 the first 1 000 soldiers will go by the end of 2017 the state department official said washington would continue to support small somali special forces units mentored by us personnel and would work with the somali government to agree criteria that could not restore support to other units it is true that some concerns have been raised on how support was utilized and distributed the federal government is working to address these somali minister of defence mohamed mursal told reuters documents senator from the us mission to somalia to the somali government show us officials are increasingly frustrated that the military is unable to account for its aid the documents paint a stark picture of a military hollowed out by corruption unable to feed pay or arm its soldiers despite hundreds of millions of dollars of support between may and june a team of us and somali officials visited nine army bases to assess whether the men were receiving food the united states provides for 5 000 soldiers we did not find the expected large quantities of food at any location there was no evidence of consumption (except at two bases) the us team wrote to the somali government at one base less than a fifth of the soldiers listed by somali commanders were present the best staffed base had 160 soldiers out of 550 only 60 had weapons many appeared to be wearing brand new uniforms this implied they were assembled merely to improve appearances the letter seen by reuters said an ongoing assessment of the somali military this year by the somali government african union and united nations drew similar conclusions the joint report seen by reuters said many soldiers lacked guns uniforms food vehicles or tents troops relied on support from au forces or local militias to survive the sna is a fragile force with extremely weak command and control the report said they are incapable of conducting effective operations or sustaining themselves most units don t have radios leaving soldiers to rely on runners to get help when mobile networks go down the report said troops lacked paper to write reports toilets boots and medical equipment such as tourniquets many slept under trees sna units were at 62 percent of their authorized strength on average only 70 percent of them had weapons the report said although the report was deeply critical diplomats praised the government for trying to quantify the scope of the problem the government deserves massive praise for doing it and being willing to talk about it michael keating the uns top official in somalia told reuters the united states also suspended a program paying soldiers 100 dollars monthly stipends in june after the federal government refused to share responsibility for receiving the payments with regional forces fighting al shabaab washington has spent 66 dollars million on stipends over the past seven years but has halted the program several times concerned the money was not going to frontline soldiers one somali document seen by reuters showed members of a 259 strong ceremonial brass band were receiving stipends this year meant for soldiers fighting militants the state departments watchdog said in a report published in october there were insufficient checks on the program and us stipends could not fund forces that commit abuses or even support insurgents officially somalias military is 26 000 strong but the payroll is stuffed with ghost soldiers pensioners and the dead whose families may be receiving their payments diplomats say intermittent payments from the government have forced many active soldiers to sell their weapons ammunition or seek other work practices the us stipends were designed to curb washington has whittled down the number of troops it pays to 8 000 from over 10 000 but there is still no reliable payroll said a mogadishu based security expert defence minister mursal said the united nations is creating a biometric database and plans to help the somali government make cash payments directly to soldiers via mobile phones the new government will also set up a separate system for widows orphans and the wounded so the payroll would adequately represent military strength he said the weakness of somali forces has deadly consequences the insurgency is striking with ever larger and more deadly attacks in the capital mogadishu and major towns a truck bomb killed more than 500 people in october and a suicide bomber killed at least 18 at a police academy on thursday yusuf a 35 year old somali soldier stationed near the indian ocean port of kismayu knows what it is like to depend on local militias and au forces to stay alive on sept 26 insurgents attacked his base at bula gadud killing 15 colleagues and wounding scores more before the local jubaland militia and au peacekeepers saved them we lost several key members in that battle especially my close friend he told reuters we tried to retreat after using all the ammunition we had a senior somali security source said when the attack happened the battalion of more than 1 000 soldiers had only been issued 300 guns defence minister mursal said the somali troops at bulagadud have since been senator more weapons somalias national security plan calls for a military of 18 000 soldiers funded by the central government and operating country wide getting there will be hard security experts say the military is dominated by a powerful clan the hawiye which would be reluctant to lose control of the lucrative security assistance revenue stream many regional governments within somalia already see the hawiye dominated federal forces as rivals rather than allies the governments ability to push reforms depends on balancing demands from federal member states lawmakers clan leaders and international partners the uns keating said it is going to take a long time and its going to run into massive clan resistance he said some clans are very dominant in the security forces somalias partners also need to get serious and coordinate better said matt bryden of the think tank sahan research according to sahan donors including the eu au turkey and uganda have trained more than 80 000 somali soldiers since 2004 bryden said records are so poor it was not clear if many had taken multiple courses or just quit afterwards it is like sand through your fingers where are they all?.,REAL

1520,on the eve of the new hampshire primary hillary clintons quest to become the countrys first female president has encountered an unexpected problem she is having trouble persuading women young and old to rally behind her cause the latest sign came sunday when a new cnn wmur survey here showed sen bernie sanders of vermont beating clinton among women by eight percentage points which represents a big shift from the results last week in the iowa caucuses where clinton won women by 11 points the survey followed unintentionally problematic comments over the weekend by madeleine albright and gloria steinem older trailblazers who were trying to encourage younger women to support clinton steinem apologized sunday for saying on a tv appearance friday night that younger women were supporting sanders because “the boys are with bernie on saturday albright drew criticism for saying that “there is a special place in hell for women who don t help each other even though she has expressed that sentiment many times before clintons struggles with women underscore the extent to which she has not yet figured out how to harness the history making potential of her candidacy in the same way that barack obama mobilized minorities and white liberals excited about electing the first black president [meet the feminists who want a man in the white house] cognizant of the challenge the clinton campaign has sought in recent days here to address the problem tweaking her speeches to put a focus on clinton as an advocate for women clinton spent part of friday with a group of female us senators

barriers of moving toward a more perfect union that appeared designed to present her candidacy as a milepost on that national journey in an appearance on nbcs “meet the press on sunday clinton defended albright saying that her words were a “lighthearted but very pointed remark which people can take however they choose “i think what she was trying to do what shes done in every setting i ve ever seen her in going back 20 plus years was to remind young women particularly that you know this struggle which many of us have been part of is not over clinton said steinem wrote on her facebook page that her remarks to comedian bill maher in which she seemed to say that pro sanders feminists were just looking for dating opportunities was a case of “talk show interruptus “i misspoke on the bill maher show recently and apologize for whats been misinterpreted as implying young women aren t serious in their politics she wrote even so steinems comments pointed to the unexpected obstacle facing clinton and her backers a deep divide among women and feminist activists over how voters should respond to her while many older womens rights advocates see the election of clinton as the next logical step in a broader movement some younger activists have expressed resentment at the notion that they should feel obligated to vote for clinton simply because shes a woman some have argued in recent months that sanders with his calls to end income inequality and make college free is arguably the more feminist candidate [in flint clinton casts herself as a problem solver and looks past nh]

enough to vote in november said clintons personal wealth and her life as a former first lady and secretary of state create a “disconnect with the entirety of women on the trail clinton has begun to show more openness and reflection about the challenges of running as a woman in office sometimes in response to challenges from other women at a student town hall at new england college on saturday a young woman told clinton that she supported her in 2008 but has doubts about her candidacy now “my concern is that your answer that nothing new was found in the benghazi hearings continues to give me some doubts the woman said “everybody knows you can t write 30 000 emails to your yoga instructor another young woman asked why her peers think that clinton is too buttoned up and “rehearsed “i do have a somewhat narrower path that i ve tried to walk i do think sometimes it comes across as a little more restrained a little more careful and i m sure thats true clinton answered “it is not just about me it is about young women women of all ages the expectations that are put upon you and how you deal with them and how you find your true voice and how you stand up for yourself and who you become many womens rights advocates say they are proud to back clinton not just because of her gender but also because of her vast experience as a lawyer first lady senator and secretary of state [the

online womens magazine dame shortly after clinton declared her candidacy nor harding said has there been a president who has faced such blatant sexism “for showing too much cleavage or having cankles

the attacks so painful she was “almost scared to see clinton announce again “when hillary lost i had this horrible fear that gloria [steinem] would never see a woman president said knox “as if the

1085,just when it seemed she might be overwhelmed by the moment though she hit her stride and began looking every bit the part of someone ready for the political prime time referencing the charleston shooting changed the trajectory of her performance tuesday night the way her leadership in the aftermath of the massacre changed her political fortunes catapulting her to the top of the list of potential republican vice presidential nominees during tuesday nights speech she smoothly transitioned from delivering republican party red meat slamming obama to pushing back against donald trump and grabbing the hope and change baton from the president what happened after the tragedy is worth pausing to think about she said our state was struck with shock pain and fear but our people would not allow hate to win we didn t have violence; we had vigils we didn t have riots; we had hugs we didn t turn against each others race or religion we turned toward god and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world before the charleston shooting haley still wasn t fully embraced by her own party in the state; she clashed with leaders of the general assembly leaders which is run by republicans and she still makes the skin of many democrats crawl because of her support for tough immigration and voter id laws as well as her refusal to accept billions of dollars of federal dollars through the affordable care act but she helped guide south carolina through an event that harkened back to its worst era while making the seemingly impossible happen removing the confederate flag from the state house lawn for those who don t understand pulling off that feat was just as miraculous as successfully separating conjoined twins the irony is that her rise came fast enough to elevate her onto the national stage but maybe a little too late her enormous value could not end up being wasted this year on a vice presidential nomination because shes much better suited to be on top of the ticket haley not bobby jindal is the closest thing to a republican version of obama shes a young (she ll be 44 years old in a week) attractive groundbreaking candidate too shes a reflection of emerging demographics too; she called herself the proud daughter of indian immigrants shes a sarah palin who can give a great speech and answer in one on one interviews which newspapers she reads and which supreme court cases she detests shes a carly fiorina who doesn t have to explain away her performance as a chief executive under her watch even though the states economy leaves too many people behind a record number of south carolinians are working and portions of the manufacturing industry are seeing a resurgence shes a marco rubio without the washington baggage her refusal to expand medicaid may be bad for poor residents but puts her a step ahead of republicans in congress who couldn t get obamacare repealed after promising for years to do so she knows how to hit her opponents as hard as ted cruz but doesn t remind voters of joe mccarthy obama has made historic appointments to the supreme court and in the attorney generals office haley appointed tim scott to the us senate paving the way for him to become the first black man from the deep south since the reconstruction era to be voted into that body obama helped steer the country out of the great recession and away from a second great depression and into the longest unbroken streak of monthly job creation in the nations history and hes guided the nation through seemingly countless natural and man made disasters one hundred and fifty years after the end of a civil war many south carolinians continue fighting any way haley helped lead the state peacefully through the aftermath of a young white supremacists killing of nine black people in one of the nations most historic churches her response to devastating never before seen floods months later reeked of competence in a state whose congressional delegation once protested pork spending by voting against hurricane sandy relief for all those reasons and more the republican party tapped her to respond to obama the irony is that if the party is looking for a candidate who will bring something in the second spot to the ticket that can move the needle haley likely isn t it despite her enormous political talent shes from one of the redder states in the union meaning haleys presence would do nothing to improve the partys electoral prospects and because shes a member of a party that most minorities blacks latinos asian americans view as hostile her personal appeal won t matter she may be able to move the needle among those groups a little more than say dr ben carson but not much at all thats why shes in the odd position of being the ideal vice presidential candidate who should have run for president if the tragedies during which her leadership abilities shined most had happened in 2014 and not 2015 maybe she would have republicans will be tempted to call on her to bring a new image and energy to the partys 2016 presidential push had they the foresight they would have pushed her to reach for higher office obama was the democrats answer to the 21st century and refused to be told to wait his turn haley could not have played that role for the republican party only time will tell if she missed her window.,REAL

188,spin and overstatement have long been a part of political rhetoric but this year is pushing fact checkers into overdrive and thats not all bad professional fact checkers might be excused for being a tad exhausted this campaign season tracking the public statements of 22 major party candidates during the primaries was one thing but a general election pitting donald trump against hillary clinton two candidates with abysmal scores for honesty among voters is another sending the fact checking world into overdrive is mr trump really worth 10 dollars billion as he claims? (not according to forbes magazine) is it true that mister clinton “slept during the benghazi terror attack in 2012 as trump says? (no according to clinton testimony) was clinton allowed to use a personal email server when she was secretary of state as she has asserted? (no according to a recent report by the state departments office of the inspector general) trump alone is enough to keep the entire fact checking industry afloat when the flamboyant billionaire gave a big speech recently denouncing clinton the associated press assigned 12 reporters just to check the veracity of his assertions “a whole platoon of journalistic talent that could not have been doing other things moaned washington post media critic erik wemple it is easy to get discouraged by all the charges of lying hurled around lyin ted lyingcrookedhillary (both a verbal trump charge and the name of a trump campaign site) handouts from the clinton campaign that lay out trumps “lies hypocrisy and catastrophic ideas and certainly to some voters the whole tone of the campaign is so depressing the answer is just to tune out and stay home on election day but to veteran fact checkers it is the time to shine angie drobnic holan editor in chief of the pulitzer prize winning site politifactcom says shes “really optimistic citing the growth of media fact checking “you can have a cynical take on that but mine is more optimistic because fact checking is especially needed this year she says “donald trump is a candidate who has persistent problems with accuracy and i m heartened that there is widespread recognition that this is someone who needs to be fact checked trump supporters not surprisingly disagree jeffrey lord a regular on cnn defending trump calls media fact checkers “elitist and says the candidates themselves do a better job of countering each others assumptions this “self policing concept sounds a bit like having a basketball game with no referees and besides it is just not going to happen media fact checking is here to stay so are politicians who say things that aren t true and accuse each other of lying but there is a spectrum of political speech there are out and out lies deliberately false statements meant to deceive then there are statements that are unintentionally false exaggerations and spin sorting through the differences can be impossible as it requires knowing whats inside the speakers head and what about a candidate who makes big promises knowing they can t be fulfilled? thats another form of political speech that is less than truthful but which voters have come to expect and often excuse in a recent focus group veteran pollster peter hart asked 12 republicans if they thought a president trump would ever actually build a wall across the mexican border eight people voted no same with his promise to deport the 11 million illegal immigrants in the us and yet most of the 12 were fine that these promises would likely go unfulfilled “they don t hear a pledge they hear i m going to do something “ says kathleen hall jamieson director of the university of pennsylvanias annenberg public policy center which sponsored the focus group but making pie in the sky promises is one thing statements of fact that prove false are another and thats where fact checkers are having a field day politifact has judged 174 statements by trump so far and found only 16 to be either true or mostly true seventy have been judged false and another 34 rated “pants on fire referring to claims that are “not only inaccurate but also ridiculous according to ms holan with clinton politifact has judged 218 statements and rated 112 true or mostly true 24 false and three “pants on fire the next question is whether the assessments of politifact and other fact checkers actually penetrate public consciousness?

352,“nation state as a fundamental unit of mans organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force international banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state zbigniew brzezinski “between two ages the technetronic era 1971 “i m going to continue to push for a no fly zone and safe havens within syria…not only to help protect the syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees but to gain some leverage on both the syrian government and the russians former secretary of state hillary clinton third presidential debate why is hillary clinton so eager to intensify us involvement in syria when us interventions in afghanistan iraq and libya have all gone so terribly wrong? the answer to this question is simple it is because clinton doesn t think that these interventions went wrong and neither do any of the other members of the us foreign policy establishment (aka the borg) in fact in their eyes these wars have been a rousing success sure a few have been critical of the public relations backlash from the nonexistent wmd in iraq (or the logistical errors like disbanding the iraqi army) but for the most part the foreign policy establishment is satisfied with its efforts to destabilize the region and remove leaders that refuse to follow washingtons diktats this is hard for ordinary people to understand they can t grasp why elite powerbrokers would want to transform functioning stable countries into uninhabitable wastelands overrun by armed extremists sectarian death squads and foreign born terrorists nor can they understand what has been gained by washingtons 15 year long rampage across the middle east and central asia that has turned a vast swathe of strategic territory into a terrorist breeding grounds? what is the purpose of all this? first we have to acknowledge that the decimation and de facto balkanization of these countries is part of a plan if it wasn t part of a plan than the decision makers would change the policy but they haven t changed the policy the policy is the same the fact that the us is using foreign born jihadists to pursue regime change in syria as opposed to us troops in iraq is not a fundamental change in the policy the ultimate goal is still the decimation of the state and the elimination of the existing government this same rule applies to libya and afghanistan both of which have been plunged into chaos by washingtons actions but why? what is gained by destroying these countries and generating so much suffering and death? heres what i think i think washington is involved in a grand project to remake the world in a way that better meets the needs of its elite constituents the international banks and multinational corporations brzezinski not only refers to this in the opening quote he also explains what is taking place the nation state is being jettisoned as the foundation upon which the global order rests instead washington is erasing borders liquidating states and removing strong secular leaders that can mount resistance to its machinations in order to impose an entirely new model on the region a new world order the people who run these elite institutions want to create an interconnected global free trade zone overseen by the proconsuls of big capital in other words a global eurozone that precludes the required state institutions (like a centralized treasury mutual debt federal transfers) that would allow the borderless entity to function properly deep state powerbrokers who set policy behind the smokescreen of our bought and paid for congress think that one world government is an achievable goal provided they control the worlds energy supplies the worlds reserve currency and become the dominant player in this centurys most populous and prosperous region asia this is essentially what hillarys “pivot to asia is all about the basic problem with washingtons nwo plan is that a growing number of powerful countries are still attached to the old world order and are now prepared to defend it this is whats really going on in syria the improbable alliance of russia syria iran and hezbollah have stopped the us military juggernaut dead in its tracks the unstoppable force has hit the immovable object and the immovable object has prevailed…so far naturally the foreign policy establishment is upset about these new developments and for good reason the us has run the world for quite a while now so the rolling back of us policy in syria is as much a surprise as it is a threat the russian airforce deployed to syria a full year ago in september but only recently has washington shown that it is prepared to respond by increasing its support of its jihadists agents on the ground and by mounting an attack on isis in the eastern part of the country raqqa but the real escalation is expected to take place when hillary clinton becomes president in 2017 thats when the us will directly engage russia militarily assuming that their tit for tat encounters will be contained within syrias borders it is a risky plan but it is the next logical step in this bloody fiasco neither party wants a nuclear war but washington believes that doing nothing is tantamount to backing down therefore hillary and her neocon advisors can be counted on to up the ante “no fly zone anyone? the assumption is that eventually and with enough pressure putin will throw in the towel but this is another miscalculation putin is not in syria because he wants to be nor is he there because he values his friendship with syrian president bashar al assad thats not it at all putin is in syria because he has no choice russias national security is at stake if washingtons strategy of deploying terrorists to topple assad succeeds then the same ploy will be attempted in iran and russia putin knows this just like he knows that the scourge of foreign backed terrorism can decimate entire regions like chechnya he knows that it is better for him to kill these extremists in aleppo than it will be in moscow so he can t back down thats not an option but by the same token he can compromise in other words his goals and the goals of assad do not perfectly coincide for example he could not very well make territorial concessions to the us for the sake of peace that assad might not support but why would he do that? why wouldn t he continue to fight until every incorporated of syrias sovereign territory is recovered? because it is not in russias national interest to do so thats why putin has never tried to conceal the fact that hes in syria to protect russias national security thats his main objective but hes not an idealist hes a pragmatist who ll do whatever he has to to end the war asap that means compromise this doesn t matter to the washington warlords…yet but it will eventually eventually there will be an accommodation of some sort no one is going to get everything they want that much is certain for example it is impossible to imagine that putin would launch a war on turkey to recover the territory that turkish troops now occupy in n syria in fact putin may have already conceded as much to turkish president tayyip erdogan in their recent meetings but that doesn t mean that putin doesn t have his red lines he does aleppo is a red line turkish troops will not be allowed to enter aleppo the western corridor the industrial and population centers are all red lines on these there will be no compromise putin will help assad remain in power and keep the country largely intact but will turkey control sections in the north and will the us control sections in the east? probably this will have to be worked out in negotiations but its unlikely that the countrys borders will be the same as they were before the war broke out putin will undoubtedly settle for a halfloaf provided the fighting ends and security is restored in any event hes not going to hang around until the last dog is hung unfortunately we are a long way from any settlement in syria mainly because washington is nowhere near accepting the fact that its project to rule the world has been derailed thats the crux of the matter isn t it? the bigshots who run the country are still in denial it hasn t sunk in yet that the war is lost and that their nutty jihadist militia plan has failed it is going to take a long time before washington gets the message that the world is no longer its oyster the sooner they figure it out the better it ll be for everyone mike whitney lives in washington state he is a contributor to hopeless barack obama and the politics of illusion (ak press) hopeless is also available in a kindle edition he can be reached at fergiewhitney@msncom.,FAKE

donald trump is going to win the election and that this will usher in a new golden age of blessing and prosperity for america supposedly this is going to happen even though we continue to slaughter babies on an industrial scale sexually transmitted diseases are spreading at the fastest pace in decades the percentage of births out of wedlock is more than 10 times higher than in 1940 and approximately two out of every three christian men watch pornography on a regular basis even though there aren t any signs of widespread national repentance we are supposedly going to be showered with wealth favor protection and good times for as far as the eye can see you can believe this if you want but it doesn t have any basis in reality the truth is that we live in a nation where just about every type of evil that you can possibly imagine is spreading like wildfire just look at the spread of sexually transmitted diseases according to the cdc there are 20 million new cases of sexually transmitted disease in the united states every year and last year cases of chlamydia gonorrhea and syphilis grew at a very alarming pace … cases of sexually transmitted diseases in the united states have reached new highs including an increase in syphilis not seen since the mid 1990s federal health officials said in a report this week there were 15 million chlamydia cases in 2015 the last year that numbers were available a 6 percent increase from the year before and about 400 000 infections of gonorrhea or a 13 percent rise according to a report by the federal centers for disease control and prevention but syphilis cases increased to levels unseen since the mid 1990s there were nearly 24 000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases last year a 19 percent hike compared with 2014 we are a nation that has fully embraced the “free love philosophy of the 1960s we have sex with whoever we want whenever we want and we don t seem to care about the consequences as a result the nuclear family is rapidly being destroyed back in 1940 38 percent of all babies were born to women that were not married today that number is over 40 percent 2008 (the year barack obama was elected) was the very first year in our history when 40 percent of all babies were born to unmarried mothers and we have now stayed at that level for eight straight years if we want to make america great again we can start by not sleeping with people that we are not married to but of course an increasing number of americans (especially our young people) are discarding traditional notions of love marriage and sexuality completely at one time we were told that the choice was between “gay and “straight but now many people have decided that they want absolutely no limits miley cyrus is among those that are now identifying themselves as “pansexuals the following comes from a recent article by jennifer leclaire … “my mom is like an 80s rock chick big blonde hair … she loves being a girl cyrus said “i never felt that way i know some girls that love getting their nails done i … hated it … i don t wax my eyebrows i never related to loving being a girl and then being a boy didn t sound fun to me i think the lgbtq alphabet could not continue forever but there is a p that should happen for pansexual according to google a “pansexual is “not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex gender or gender identity millions of young girls look up to miley cyrus as a role model we knew that this sort of thing was coming in the last days but it is still hard to grasp how far america has fallen and if you try to speak out against this wave of evil you might just lose everything for instance the bakery in oregon that didn t want to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple has been forced to close their doors permanently … the oregon bakery that made news after it refused to make a cake for a lesbian couples wedding has closed after legal battles left the business financial devastated according to a christian news site aaron and melissa klein owners of sweet cakes by melissa have shut down their bakery according to the stores facebook page we have closed sweet cakes we appreciate everyones continued prayer and support the post said we live in a nation where the culture has been fundamentally transformed according to a newly released pew research center survey an all time high 57 percent of all americans believe that marijuana should be legalized and only 37 percent are against it with that kind of a margin it is only a matter of time before marijuana is legalized all over the country we also live in a nation that is absolutely addicted to watching other people have sex and most christian men cannot even speak out about this epidemic because they are doing it themselves according to charisma news one survey found that an astounding 68 percent of all christian men admit that they watch pornography on a regular basis but even if we turned away from all of the other behaviors that i have just mentioned there would still be no hope for our nation as long as we continue to murder babies on an industrial scale did you see the final debate between donald trump and hillary clinton? during that debate clinton made it exceedingly clear that she is in favor of abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy the democratic platform openly calls for taxpayer funding of abortion and a complete repeal of the hyde amendment and bill and hillary clinton have made abortion one of the central pillars of their very long political careers their hands are absolutely drenched with the blood of dead children and the american people are about to reward her by making her the next president of the united states so no i don t buy it when people try to tell me that america is on the verge of a new era of greatness the truth is that we are a cesspool of wickedness and filth and unless we repent we are going to reap a very bitter harvest from what we have sown for so many years submit your review.,FAKE

742,leave a reply michael snyder donald trump has all the momentum now will it be enough to propel him to victory on election day? trumps poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the fbi had renewed its investigation into hillary clintons emails and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on monday make it clear that clintons “certain victory is not so certain after all unless something changes americans are going to go to the polls on november 8th with an fbi criminal investigation hanging over the clinton campaign like an ominous cloud and that is very good news for trump the clinton campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not “move the needle but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case hillarys unfavorable rating just hit an all time high a whopping 45 percent of all americans believe that this scandal is “worse than watergate and a rasmussen survey has found that 40 percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for hillary clinton are still open to changing their minds before election day and even before this story broke on friday clinton was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls according to the new york times early voting among young adults and african american voters is significantly down compared to 2012 and those are demographic groups that clinton desperately needs to turn out in large numbers but of course the key to winning the election is getting to 270 electoral votes and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that trump and clinton both desperately need for a moment i would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states… florida without florida donald trump has absolutely no chance of winning this is something that even the trump campaign has admitted that is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in october had hillary clinton leading in the state fortunately for trump a new survey that was conducted on sunday shows him leading in florida by four points georgia georgia wasn t supposed to be a problem georgia has traditionally been a deep red state but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race this had republicans deeply concerned and the clinton camp very happy but now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has trump up by seven points north carolina mitt romney won north carolina in 2012 and donald trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on november 8th hillary clinton was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story broke but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points ohio no republican has ever won the presidency without ohio and trump knows how important it is to his chances the three most recent polls conducted before the fbi renewed the investigation into hillary clintons emails all showed a tie but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows trump up by five points colorado hillary clinton has consistently been in the lead in colorado throughout this campaign and most experts didn t give trump much of a chance in the state but the latest survey shows that clintons lead has been whittled down to just one point arizona a survey that was conducted in mid october showed clinton having a five point lead in john mccains home state but now the latest major poll has trump up by two points nevada one of the most important swing states out west is nevada and most surveys showed hillary clinton with a strong lead throughout the month of october unfortunately for her a poll that was conducted on sunday shows donald trump with a four point lead clearly trump has the momentum at this point and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days and as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered emails will her fellow democrats stick with her? already some are publicly wavering the following example comes from wnd … longtime clinton confidante and former democratic pollster doug schoen told fox news the newly renewed fbi investigation into hillary clintons private email server is forcing him to “reassess his support for the democratic nominee for president schoen a fox news contributor made the comments to host harris faulkner during a live television appearance sunday night on “fox report weekend public opinion is shifting quickly but the bad news for trump is that more than 23 million americans have already voted so millions upon millions of americans cast their votes before they even learned of this new fbi investigation if the race is very close that could not end up making the difference and of course the race could not dramatically change once again if the fbi comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to november 8th on monday cnn reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely… fbi officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into hillary clintons private server before the november 8 election the initial work of cataloging top clinton aide huma abedins emails found on her estranged husband anthony weiners laptop could not be done in the next few days us law enforcement officials told cnn but the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what if any classified materials are in the emails this makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election however late on monday evening the drudge report reported that the la times has learned that investigators may have a “preliminary assessment completed “in coming days… la times tuesday fbi investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks it now hopes to complete preliminary assessment in coming days but agency officials have not decided how or whether they will disclose results publicly… developing… whether good or bad i do believe that the american people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before november 8th if nothing is found to implicate clinton the american people should be told that and if evidence of very serious crimes is discovered there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos the american people deserve to know the truth but will we get it?

272,the four men two of them brothers who turned ordinary morning commutes in brussels into blood soaked nightmares may have been spurred into action by fears that authorities were closing in on them according to a note left by one of the attackers that was described by a prosecutor wednesday days before the attacks on tuesday counter­terrorism police had raided their brussels safe houses an ally who took part in novembers paris carnage was shot and captured by authorities and ibrahim el bakraoui a 29 year old belgian with a thick rap sheet wrote that he did not want to wind up in a prison cell belgian federal prosecutor frederic van leeuw said wednesday the men at least two of whom had direct ties to the islamic state attacks in paris knew they had to act decisively so they set out with explosives that ripped open a brussels subway car and shattered the citys main airport terminal killing at least 31 people and injuring 300 in the bloodiest attack on belgian soil since world war ii bakraoui detonated a suitcase full of nails screws and powerful explosives at the airport killing himself in the process van leeuw said so did islamic state bombmaker najim laachraoui 24 who is also believed to have prepared explosives for the paris attacks according to an arab intelligence official and a european intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly an unidentified man who left an even larger suitcase of explosives at the airport is believed to still be at large he said that suitcase did not immediately detonate sparing belgium even more casualties the country held a national minute of silence wednesday led by prime minister charles michel who laid a wreath at the maelbeek metro station in honor of the victims thousands of belgians gathered in a somber ceremony in front of an ornate 19th century stock exchange building to light candles and lay flowers the missive contained in a computer that had been chucked into a garbage can near bakraouis brussels apartment does not specifically cite recent raids across belgium including one that netted a key suspect in the paris attacks but its tone suggests a sense that the noose was tightening van leeuw said the computer message also gives apparent insight into the organization and motivation of militants who apparently turned their attention to brussels after pulling off the paris attacks that killed 130 people in the note bakraoui described feeling pressure bearing down he wrote that he was “in a hurry no longer knowing what to do being searched for everywhere no longer secure according to van leeuws description of the message which was not made public laachraouis involvement draws the boldest line yet between the paris attacks and those in brussels his dna was found on explosives in the paris attacks and authorities believe that he was versed in the islamic state art of assembling powerful explosives from ingredients that are readily available his participation in two attacks suggests that the islamic state is increasingly able to strike on european soil although his death may also mean that he feared imminent capture by european authorities terrorism experts regard bomb­makers especially those trained in handling sensitive explosives as among the most valuable and protected members of a terrorist organization it is highly unusual for them to participate in suicide attacks themselves [why is brussels under attack?] laachraouis dna was found in a brussels apartment raided last week the discovery of a militant cell there eventually led to the arrest of salah abdeslam on friday abdeslam was the final at large direct participant in the paris attacks and is believed to have been the logistics mastermind the computer file that prosecutors cited wednesday does not mention abdeslam by name but it says the attackers feared that if they did not strike quickly they risked winding up in prison alongside “him “if they drag on they risk finishing next to him in a cell van leeuw said paraphrasing the contents of the file van leeuw described the file as a “will discovered on a computer he did not explain why authorities believed the computer belonged to bakraoui bakraouis younger brother khalid el bakraoui 27 is believed to have been the suicide bomber on a brussels subway car that blew up as it sped out of a station underneath the heart of the european union quarter of brussels an area packed with embassies and international organizations that attack came 73 minutes after the one at the airport meaning that commuters were already reading the news of the first explosions when the carnage reached them khalid el bakraoui appears to have been a kind of surreptitious real estate broker for the plotters according to a european security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case using assumed names he rented an apartment in the forest area of brussels where abdeslams fingerprints were found and an apartment near charleroi belgium where paris attack mastermind abdelhamid abaaoud stayed as he plotted the violence both bakraoui brothers served prison time for violent crime the european security official said the announcement on wednesday that two of the attackers were brothers highlighted another emerging tactic from the militant group they would be the third pair of brothers involved in an islamic state attack in europe in the past 15 months european security leaders planned to gather thursday in brussels to discuss whether to pursue new policies that would better pool information to counter terrorism french prime minister manuel valls visiting brussels on wednesday to extend his condolences repeated past calls for sweeping new powers to be given to european intelligence agencies “in the years to come the [eu] member states will have to invest massively in their security systems he said [brussels terrorists probably used explosive nicknamed the mother of satan ] van leeuw the belgian prosecutor said the brothers had not previously been suspected of ties to terrorism turkish president recep tayyip erdogan said wednesday that turkey had deported one of the attackers to europe in july and warned european counter­terrorism officials that it believed the man was a militant suggesting a serious lapse by belgian authorities interpol had also issued a “red notice effectively an international arrest warrant for one of the suspects at the request of belgian authorities it was not immediately clear when that notice had been issued there were signs that an even bigger attack had been forestalled authorities found large stockpiles of bomb building materials at ibrahim el bakraouis apartment in the schaerbeek area of brussels the prosecutor said 33 pounds of tatp explosives nearly 40 gallons of acetone 8 gallons of hydrogen peroxide detonators and a suitcase full of nails and screws both acetone and hydrogen peroxide are easily obtainable; together they can be used to make potent explosives it remained unclear wednesday how many americans had been killed in the blasts in washington state department deputy spokesman march toner said that “approximately a dozen americans were injured but that “a number of us citizens remained unaccounted for on wednesday

lady us senator and secretary of state was the first woman to lead the presidential ticket of a major political party hillary clinton meanwhile broke with obama by uttering the words radical islamism rhetoric that she has long resisted for fear that it would embolden terrorists terrorist attacks often have the potential to radically shift the political conversation trumps proposed temporary ban on muslim immigrants in the aftermath of the san bernardino california attacks for instance deeply resonated with republican party primary voters but the responses this week in which trump and clinton made moves that would have been unexpected a week ago reflect the unusual confluence of gay rights gun control and national security in the wake of orlando and underscore the volatile nature of american politics this year no one is more unusual at the moment than trump he started the week by tearing up the terrorism 101 rule book used by most politicians who go out of their way to foster unity in the wake of such an outrage trump did the exact opposite hours after sundays attack unfolded he issued a self congratulatory tweet that noted his long stance that radical islam leads to terrorism on monday he implied obama was somehow complicit or sympathetic toward the us born muslim who went on the rampage and later snatched away the campaign credentials of the washington post when it reported on his comments trump has never been known for consistency and demonstrated his ability to hold several contradictory positions on issues that motivate the republican base at the same time after the orlando carnage trump suggested that if the people in the nightclub had guns themselves the story could not have been different and he stirred his audiences with false claims that clinton wanted to take away americans guns but then perhaps scenting a change in the political wind trump said he would meet with the national rifle association to discuss how to stop people on the terror watch list or fbi no fly lists from buying guns in contradiction with previous republican positions but during a thursday rally in dallas he again seemed to take a hard line on guns repeating his claim about clinton and saying i m going to save your second amendment rights trump repeatedly claimed that he was the best friend the lgbt community has in this election rather than clinton who has been deeply engaged in lgbt issues for years and counts the community as a deep well of support and donor dollars clinton could not not resist trolling her general election foe when cnn reporter phil mattingly quoted trump on twitter as saying you tell me who is better for the gay community and who is better for women than donald trump the former secretary of states campaign account tweeted back hi trump expounded further on his gun views friday evening at a texas rally trump argued as he often has in the wake of terrorist attacks and mass shootings that fewer gun restrictions would have lessened the death toll if we had people where the bullets were going in the opposite direction right smack between the eyes of this maniac trump said gesturing between his eyes and this son of a b comes out and starts shooting and one of the people in that room happened to have (a gun) and goes boom you know what that would have been a beautiful beautiful sight folks trump also slammed president barack obama for arguing for action to change existing gun laws in the wake of the mass shooting in orlando president obama is trying to make terrorism into guns and it is not guns folks it is not guns folks it is not guns this is terrorism trump said but trump was not the only politician pulling off a role reversal toward the gay community iowa rep steve king who once warned his state could not become a gay marriage mecca after its supreme court lifted a ban on same sex marriage offered a striking shift in tone this week i think it was clear that gays were targeted in orlando and it does matter and it is tragic that they were targeted because of their sexual orientation king told cnns chris cuomo on new day that was a rare moment of conciliation in what was a largely divisive political week in fact the manner in which the orlando attack immediately became political fodder contrasted with the numbing wave of shock that settled over the united kingdom where campaigning for next weeks europe union referendum was put on hold after the murder of lawmaker jo cox trump and clinton were hardly alone in the political fray this week with seven months left in his term obama could not have left it to the newly minted democratic presumptive nominee to carry the fight to trump but he felt a need to respond especially to trumps comments thats not the america we want he said during an extraordinarily direct speech on tuesday it doesn t reflect our democratic ideals it will make us less safe by wading so deeply into the presidential race obama was offering a preview of the kind of political assist he could not provide clinton as he hits the campaign trail soon as a surrogate but on tuesday at least obama completely overshadowed his preferred successor the normal order is also disrupted on capitol hill republican leaders are stuck in an uncomfortable marriage with their can t live with him can t live without him presidential nominee who is showing no signs of

some chasm in the middle of our party sanders is proving that piloting a soft landing to a political revolution is tough while he vowed on thursday to help clinton defeat trump he still wants full

heat when blasted obama as directly responsible for the mass shooting in orlando then like a character from a previous more courtly political age he had second thoughts and issued a statement that clarified that he meant that the presidents policies were to blame rather than the character of the man who beat him for the white house eight years ago a politician who admits he was wrong in the

1234,out on the campaign trail donald trump relishes his feud with his own party he threatened to sue the republican national committee he called its nominating system “rigged “deceptive and “a disgrace and he has suggested he might try to depose the party chairman but as rnc members gathered at a palatial beach resort here this week trumps aides launched an urgent effort aimed at rebranding the moguls persona and thawing hostilities with the skittish party elite “we need unity as soon as possible said ed cox the new york party chairman and a trump supporter yet while the charm offensive has made some progress interviews with dozens of republican party officials here showed that the celebrity billionaire still has to overcome a host of lingering concerns both about his loyalty to the party as well as his discipline and electability as a candidate “we are the ones that built this party said jonathan barnett a national committeeman from arkansas “you see so many states where they have never reached out or built an organization    remember we are good people we are the grass roots we ve been around a long time and trump needs us trumps top campaign aide paul manafort assured rnc members here that trump views the party leadership as “partners both in raising money and crafting a state by state strategy and that his hot rhetoric has been “a part that hes been playing and will soon give way to a more presidential demeanor [trump is playing a part and can transform for victory aide says] some members were skeptical of manaforts pitch “trump keeps saying that hes going to be so presidential that he ll put you to sleep said josé cunningham chairman of the district of columbia republican party “he loves to say that his people say he ll do that have that demeanor i d still like to see that because well we haven t trump himself is taking steps to repair relations rnc chairman reince priebus called the billionaire mogul on wednesday to congratulate him on his blowout victory in the new york primary “we had a great talk no problem priebus said in an interview “donald trump is conciliatory you notice he hasn t been saying rnc lately he hasn t been saying that lately he certainly hasn t been talking about me lately priebus acknowledged that there probably are political benefits for trump to rail against the process and use the rnc as a foil “they ve made a calculation somehow that it works ginning people up over accusations that the delegate selection process is rigged priebus said “i don t think they would be doing it on a lark priebus said that the process is not skewed against trump “nothings rigged just like nothing was rigged in new york when the top vote getter got 60 percent of the vote but received 90 percent of the delegates trumps rhetoric fits into his broader playbook to run against what he sees as corruption across the economic and political spectrums manafort said in an interview that trumps portrayal of the republican party nominating rules “is no different than the rigged economy the rigged banking system “it fits into the whole narrative of the system is broken and certain types of establishment situations don t meet the expectations of people he said [it is on tensions between trump and the republican party escalate in public fight] for much of the campaign the trump operation seemed to alienate even shun party officials who are accustomed to courtship by candidates many officials took particular umbrage at trumps on and off public flirtation with ousting priebus “stop the attacks on reince and the rnc leadership south carolina republican party chairman matt moore said “reince is the best chairman i think in the partys history and there is no question that he is the guy to lead us into the general election any discussion about a new chairman is completely stupid on that point manafort said “this discussion over the last few weeks has not been an anti reince campaign trump has been outfoxed by his chief republican rival sen ted cruz of texas at state conventions and other gatherings where delegates to the national convention are selected manafort said trump is not seeking to upend the existing rules but believes the system lacks transparency and is trying to lay the groundwork for changes in future years cruz and ohio gov john kasich addressed the rnc this week also present were leaders of our principles pac an anti trump super pac who huddled privately with some members friday the groups chairwoman katie packer distributed a memorandum urging party leaders to do everything possible to stop trump from locking up the nomination “it is not too late packer wrote “you are under no obligation to wrap your arms around a candidate who has not won a majority of republican party votes or a majority of delegates and perhaps wouldn t even be the frontrunner had the original field been much smaller yet in hallway chatter here there was a growing sense of resignation about trump as the nominee “i sense that everybody has come around to the position that what we choose is what we choose and that to have an opponent to hillary clinton you take what you got and you run with it as fast as you can said david norcross a former rnc general counsel [is it too late for a donald trump makeover?] the conversations in florida come amid a revamping of trumps campaign manafort said trump is assembling teams of communications specialists schedulers policy advisers speechwriters researchers and liaisons to capitol hill think tanks and other republican party power centers all traditional campaign elements that had been lacking in trumps shoestring structure “we couldn t run a general election with eight people manafort said manafort suggested that the individuals who have been appearing on cable television shows as trump representatives will begin playing smaller roles as he asserts control over what he called “the narrative “now we are transitioning manafort said “hes trying to be the nominee and people want to see the entire package among the newest members of trumps team is rick wiley who is well known to rnc members serving as the committees political director in 2012 when he addressed rnc members on thursday wiley sought to emphasize those connections and went out of his way to praise the work of the committees staff under priebus wiley said the party and its nominee would be fully committed to waging a successful fall national campaign arguing that the rnc had adapted the organizing model developed by the 2008 obama campaign he added “we are going to inherit a field program second to none in his presentation wiley addressed worries among many republicans that trump as the nominee could not lead the party to a catastrophic defeat in the fall one that could not put its senate majority at risk and cost republicans house seats “you re going to see this map expand he said contending that trumps potential appeal to reagan democrats working class white voters could not make states in the upper and industrial midwest that long have been in the democrats column competitive in the fall “if we are playing in these states and we are winning in some of these states and the democrats are playing and having to spend money in those states he said “it is a good thing for us it is a good thing for the party.,REAL

4340,washington (reuters) the afl cio the largest us federation of labor unions will launch digital attack ads targeting republican front runner donald trump next week as part of a multi pronged effort to derail the new york billionaires bid for the white house and dampen union workers enthusiasm for him officials at the afl cio an umbrella group of 56 unions representing 125 million workers told reuters the ads will depict trump as anti union and will appear on facebook and twitter the officials said the anti trump advertising effort would likely expand over the coming months at the same time an afl cio affiliate organization will ramp up a door to door campaign to undermine the candidate in ohio and pennsylvania key battleground states in the nov 8 presidential election “donald trump has tapped into the very real and understandable anger of working people but while he says hes with americas working people when you look close it is just hot air afl cio president richard trumka told reuters “donald trump is nothing but a house of cards and once we educate people the house of cards comes crashing down he said union leaders are increasingly concerned about trumps appeal to labor typically a stronghold of the democratic party because of his promises to scrap free trade deals that have led to manufacturing job losses in the united states the afl cio is entering the political fray several months earlier than in past elections given the “unique cycle created by trumps candidacy spokesman josh goldstein said the initial ads will be modeled after a text message blast that began thursday featuring an image of trump with a statement he made supporting “right to work laws which weaken organized labor by limiting their ability to collect membership dues several states have passed such laws and the us congress has considered a similar measure “i like right to work my position on right to work is 100 percent trump said in a radio interview in south carolina last month the text campaign on which the ads will be modeled featured a quote from trumka hitting trump on right to work and characterizing him as racist “donald trumps bigoted comments are bad enough now he supports right to work tell him right to work is wrong for working people trump has been widely criticized for describing mexican illegal immigrants as rapists and criminals and for proposing a temporary ban on muslims seeking to come to the united states the afl cio declined to say how much the initial digital ads would cost but the federation spent nearly 9 dollars million in the 2012 election cycle on outside spending in addition to money given directly to candidates according to open secrets data the afl cio typically waits to endorse a presidential candidate until there is a de facto democratic nominee but trumka a former coal miner and leader of that union has made clear he believes trump in particular would be a disastrous candidate for workers in a speech last week he called him a “bigot and “anti american an official representing trumps campaign was not immediately available to comment but trump has said repeatedly that he has support within unions national unions nearly always endorse democratic presidential candidates but trump has built his insurgent campaign in part on a mission that many unions share scrapping international trade deals there are some signs trumps message is resonating beyond the 20 to 30 percent of rank and file union members that vote republican attracting political independents and even some frustrated democrats at a recent picket outside a steel plant near canton ohio workers cited former president bill clintons support of the north american free trade agreement more than 20 years ago as a reason why they may support trump

1948,washington (reuters) president donald trumps effort to roll back obamacare gained momentum on wednesday as republican leaders scheduled a vote in the house of representatives on thursday on newly revised legislation house majority leader kevin mccarthy expressed confidence the bill would pass and several moderate republican lawmakers who previously objected to the bill said they could not now support it a vote was expected as early as midday thursday with lawmakers planning to leave town later that day for a week long recess late on wednesday the bill cleared a procedural step allowing it to advance to the house floor even if a narrow majority in the house approves the bill it still faces a steep climb in the senate where only a few defections could not kill the effort keen to score his first major legislative win since taking office in january trump threw his own political capital behind the bill meeting with lawmakers and calling them in an effort to cajole their support trump whose republican party controls both the house and senate is seeking to make good on his campaign promise to repeal and replace obamacare aides said he worked the phones furiously wavering moderate republicans had worried that the legislation to overhaul president barack obamas 2010 signature healthcare law would leave too many people with pre existing medical conditions unable to afford health coverage but several republican skeptics got behind the bill after they met with trump to float a compromise proposal that is still expected to face unanimous democratic opposition the legislations prospects brightened further after members of the freedom caucus a faction of conservative lawmakers in the house who played a key role in derailing the original version of the bill last month said they could not go along with the compromise the bill is also receiving a torrent of opposition from medical groups including the american medical association who say millions of americans will lose coverage or face higher costs millions more americans got healthcare coverage under obamacare but republicans have long attacked it they view it as a government intrusion into the healthcare system and blame it for driving up costs called the american health care act the republican bill would repeal most obamacare taxes including a penalty for not buying health insurance it would slash funding for medicaid the program that provides insurance for the poor and roll back much of medicaids expansion the latest effort comes after earlier pushes by trump for healthcare reform collapsed twice underscoring the difficulty of rallying together the republican partys divided factions earlier this week prospects for the legislation appeared grim as several influential moderate republicans said they could not not support the bill citing their concerns about protecting people with pre existing conditions putting a spotlight on the concerns about pre existing conditions late night talk show host jimmy kimmel made a tearful plea for keeping that provision in obamacare as he recounted a medical emergency that arose with his newborn son kimmels monologue about his sons congenital heart condition was viewed nearly 19 million times on his shows facebook page and on wednesday morning was the no 1 trending story on youtube republican representatives fred upton and billy long who were part of a group of moderate lawmakers who met at the white house with trump said the president endorsed their plan to add 8 dollars billion over five years to help cover the cost for people with pre existing illnesses who could not otherwise be priced out of insurance markets describing trumps efforts to secure his support long said trump told him “billy we really need you man representative march meadows chairman of the conservative freedom caucus said the new language on pre existing conditions was a “net plus for garnering the votes needed to pass the healthcare bill critics of the changes to the law including several health policy experts said the 8 dollars billion could not not be enough to cover the cost of coverage for the sickest patients republicans did not await a new score from the nonpartisan congressional budget office to see how many people would be insured under their revised plan and how much it would cost health insurers such as anthem inc (antmn) unitedhealth group inc (unhn) aetna inc (aetn) and cigna corp (cin) have faced months of uncertainty over healthcares future so have hospital companies such as hca holdings inc (hcan) and tenet healthcare corp (thcn) on wednesday aetna said it will exit the obamacare individual insurance market in virginia next year citing “growing uncertainty and expected losses this year house democrats rejected the latest change to the republican legislation on wednesday saying patients with pre existing illnesses would be vulnerable to being pushed off their insurance in certain states and face higher costs “this is deadly house democratic leader nancy pelosi told a news conference “no band aid will fix it democrats have long thought their best chance of stopping the repeal would be in the senate where only a few republicans would need to defect to stop the law from moving forward the difficulty in the house is now making democrats optimistic that republicans will face backlash from voters and face losing seats in the 2018 midterm elections.,REAL

1107,washington (cnn) the tumult in the republican party with a presidential race growing increasingly nasty chaos engulfing the house republican party and a fall full of legislative crises is fueling concern among party officials that they could not blow their chance at 2016 if they don t immediately right the ship coming on the heels of ben carsons criticism of muslims donald trumps repudiation of undocumented immigrants from mexico and a presidential race where personal insults are flying the sudden resignation of house speaker john boehner is creating an unease the party establishment has not experienced in years it is tough enough to win elections by offending every demographic group that we can identify said sen jeff flake r arizona what we ve seen in prior elections is you could not say until you re blue in the face thats not my view but if the head of the ticket or those running for the head of the ticket are espousing that view it hurts it really does the anxiety is a sharp departure from the heady days after the 2014 midterm elections when republican party leaders promised they could not govern effectively and present a compelling vision for the country despite the largest house republican conference since 1928 and an eight seat senate majority congress is just as divided and gridlocked as it was when the republican party only held the house and democrats ruled the senate those differences will become more pronounced with new house leadership eager to take on president barack obama and their senate counterparts setting up high profile fiscal showdowns over the debt limit and budget this is a manage by crisis town said sen steve daines a freshman republican and former congressman from montana we ve got to get out of this cycle adding to the fear is the expectation that the already unwieldy republican party presidential race will continue to drag on well into 2016 showing an ugly side of the party to the american public just as they have a chance to take over the white house if people don t think you are being respectful or they don t think you particularly like them they certainly are not going to be attracted to you or support you said sen john cornyn of texas the no 2 senate republican referring to the trump and carson comments i think we need to be more careful and be respectful if it starts becoming part of our brand or our party then it hurts everybody still republican leaders argue their significant majority hasn t been for naught having passed sweeping trade legislation changes to medicare rules and an overhaul of surveillance laws and some republicans believe their prospects will improve if they can pull off an orderly succession to boehner and that the acrimony in the presidential race will eventually subside with the party uniting behind one candidate the jockeying is early enough in the process that i don t see a long term effect said sen john thune no 3 in republican party leadership he quickly added obviously you don t want to see our guys beating the heck out of each other but after advancing a stopgap spending bill in the senate monday night republicans are only pushing the bigger ticket fights until later into the congressional year it will grow harder to resolve sticky issues including raising the debt ceiling and finding a long term budget plan particularly as conservatives in the house try to stiffen the spines of their newly elected leadership team and those new leaders seek to prove their conservative bona fides the intraparty fighting is part of a long running battle between conservative tea party groups and the republican party establishment which have sparred since the 2010 elections over tactics and strategy tea party lawmakers are hailing boehners upcoming departure as one of their biggest achievements saying the party leadership needs to adhere to their principles not water down their conservative ideology we need a new speaker who can stand up to the president said rep tim huelskamp a kansas republican and member of the house freedom caucus i fully expect there will be more candidates who run for speaker the debate will head behind closed doors tuesday as the house republican party conference will meet for a special meeting to discuss the partys future for the first time since boehner stunned the political world friday house majority leader kevin mccarthy a california republican is the leading contender to replace boehner as speaker despite only serving eight years in the house mccarthy has developed deep relationships across the ideological spectrum and has been working methodically to lock down support ahead of his bid but he still has to contend with a group of roughly 30 members in the house freedom caucus which is calling on the conference to elect a rock ribbed conservative and take its time before holding leadership elections the group which has been a persistent thorn in boehners side as hes tried to lead the divided house has not formally endorsed a candidate yet for the position mccarthy so far only faces a nominal challenge from rep daniel webster a florida republican who mustered just 12 votes when he challenged boehner last year in his letter to his caucus monday mccarthy made clear that he would have the courage to lead the fight for our conservative principles and make our case to the american people some conservatives hope thats the case we told people give us the senate and things would be different said rep mick mulvaney r south carolina on fox news sunday we told them back in 2010 give us the house and things will be different things are not that different there is a reason the american people are fed up with washington sen ted cruz r texas said in an impassioned floor speech monday evening there is a reason the american people are frustrated the frustration is not simply mild or passing or ephemeral it is volcanic with backlash from the right growing the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell took to the floor monday afternoon to defend his chamber against charges that it hasn t fulfilled its promises to voters he touted the work the republican party has accomplished and blamed gridlock squarely on democrats for bottling up the chamber a message echoed by his close allies it takes two to tango said sen lamar alexander r tennessee we ve done our job for republicans the concern comes as polls show voters growing increasingly critical of their leaders in washington and it comes as republicans have to worry about a daunting senate map in 2016 with 24 seats in cycle compared to only 10 for democrats sen rob portman of ohio who faces a tough reelection next year said that the acrimony in his party actually could not give those of us who want to distinguish ourselves an opportunity to do so but he added that some of the more incendiary comments espoused by his presidential candidates create a brand issue for republicans i would say to the candidates talk about the democrats more portman said and that would help me more frankly if they were talking more about the differences between the two parties rather than the intramural fight cornyn added we are going to nominate somebody or elect somebody who will be a respectful or inclusive person right now it makes headlines but i don t think it represents where republican party is or where it should go.,REAL

the democratic latino coalition has always had an achilles heel that includes three critical latino segments cuban americans who don t have an immigration issue thanks to the us dry foot wet foot policy; puerto ricans who similarly do not have an immigration issue because all puerto ricans are born us citizens; and finally multigenerational mexican americans who for the most part do not have immigration concerns not that these us latinos don t have empathy or support for latino immigrants and their struggle but it is not their top priority jeb bush understood the latino sweet spot and how these voters were ripe to support him which is why the clinton campaign worried more about jeb bush than any other republican party candidate but it is hard to see how this will work for trump particularly if they got an earful of his call to arms against immigrants later in the evening on national television these latino swing voters appear to have coalesced behind secretary clinton who has a long and authentic history with the latino communities from texas to puerto rico what the mexican president did today was to reframe the us mexico relationship by emphasizing how the border economy affects far more than just us latinos it floats the economies of major states from california to texas in their joint appearance the debate shifted away however briefly from finger pointing to bi national shared governance the exclusive focus on undocumented immigration expanded to include discussion of the illegal flow between both countries of cash drugs and guns and how they contribute to perpetuating gangs and drug cartels what the trump meeting also showed is how little we actually understand how the major cogs of the us economy work our reliance on trading partners like mexico the benefits that have redounded to both nations under free trade agreements and the importance of perfecting but not discarding bilateral commercial agreements trump may have won the optics of the day (the first part at least) and he may have somewhat resuscitated his campaign deemed by many to be on life support but the issue is whether this moment will propel trump all the way to the white house.,REAL

823,heres in the half burned church of st march al tahira in qaraqosh several dozen syriac catholics are holding a mass in aramaic amid the wreckage left by isis the upper part of the stone columns and the nave are scorched black by fire and the only artificial light comes from three or four candles flickering on an improvised altar isis fighters used the courtyard outside as a firing range and metal targets set at one end of it are riddled with bullets in his sermon the syriac catholic bishop of baghdad yusuf abba calls for the congregation to show cooperation and goodwill to all but the people of qaraqosh an overwhelmingly christian town 20 miles south east of mosul wonder just how much goodwill and cooperation they can expect in return the christians are still traumatised by the disasters of the last two and a half years when isis took qaraqosh on 8 august 2014 it had a population of 44 000 almost all syriac catholics who fled for their lives to irbil the capital of the kurdistan regional government some 40 per cent of these have since migrated further to countries like australia and france or within the middle east to istanbul and lebanon but the 28 000 people from qaraqosh who stayed inside iraq have understandable doubts about going home even if isis is fully defeated and loses mosul “there is no security while isis is still in mosul says yohanna towara a farmer teacher and community leader in the town but even when isis is gone the christians will be vulnerable he says that “the priority is for us to control our local affairs and to know who will rule the area in which we live he adds that the need for permanent security outweighs the need to repair the destruction wrought primarily by isis but also by us led air strikes this destruction is bad enough though it is not total isis fighters set fire to many ordinary houses in addition to the churches in the days before they left but possibly because there was no furniture left to burn since it all had been looted most of these houses look as if they could not be made habitable after extensive repairs it will take time because not only has the furniture gone but cookers and fridges so even if light fittings or taps are still in place there is no water or electricity isis did not fight for qaraqosh and there are no booby traps or improvised explosive devices but they must at one time have thought of doing so because they dug networks of tunnels in the nearby christian village of karemlash as if they intended to wage an underground guerrilla war against the iraqi army in the event there are few signs of isis resistance except the rather pathetic remains of burned out tyres which they set fire to in order to create a smoke haze to impede the visibility of the aircraft of the us led coalition there were not many air strikes but where they did take place the results devastated whole buildings reducing them to heaps of rubble visiting qaraqosh from irbil 40 miles away it is easy to understand why people displaced from qaraqosh and in the rest of the nineveh plain feel insecure and dubious about returning to their old homes even where they are still standing they know that if they do they will be at the mercy of arab and kurdish authorities eager to fill the vacuum left by the fall of isis and wishing to stake new claims to territory and power arriving at a kurdish peshmerga checkpoint on the main road from the kurdish region to mosul at 9am we make our way through crowds of people originally from qaraqosh waiting to pass through “see how they are treating people says a critical christian observer “people have been waiting here since 5 or 6am but the peshmerga say they need a senior officer to give permission for them to pass after another two peshmerga checkpoints we reach an iraqi army checkpoint with whom the christians have better relations the nineveh plain east of mosul was home to a mosaic of minorities and its abandoned villages show various levels of destruction depending on their sectarian and ethnic complexion for instance some had once contained sunni and shia shabak (a heterodox sect speaking a dialect of kurdish) but isis had destroyed the houses of the shia but left the sunni closer to qaraqosh the checkpoints are manned by soldiers of the iraqi army and local christian members of the nineveh protection units (npu) with their multi coloured red white and blue flags relations between the npu and the army appear good but the soldiers are shia and at one checkpoint they had laid out a table and were serving sweet tea and biscuits as part of the shia arbaeen commemoration the diversity of officially sanctioned armed groups appears never ending at some checkpoints there were also visible the dark uniforms of federal police whom locals say are recruited from the shabak and turkmen communities fear of isis had united diverse groupings and communities but that unity is showing signs of fraying the peshmerga are excluded from fighting inside mosul city but are building a rampart and ditch to denote their front line the kurds may be pleased to see isis defeated in mosul but if it is defeated by a reconstituted and effective iraqi army very different from the large but ill commanded and corrupt army that fled from isis in 2014 then the balance of power in northern iraq will change against the kurds the outcome of the war all over iraq and syria has ensured that minorities that were once spread throughout the two countries now only feel secure if they can rule their own territory but in iraq the christians do not have the numbers to defend themselves (reprinted from the independent by permission of author or representative).,FAKE

it is an oft repeated question every presidential campaign but the peculiar dynamics of this race make the answer less certain in the past disgruntled primary voters have rallied to the eventual nominee by one measure the tea party insurgents who seemingly held their nose to vote for mitt romney in 2012 were actually among his most active supporters during the general election there are indicators that the same thing could not happen on the democratic side this time but clinton and trump are two of the three least popular presidential candidates of the past 24 years according to gallup and the question for republicans is reversed if mr trump wins will the moderate and establishment conservatives rally to his cause? that answer appears less certain for their part sanders voters aren t conceding yet their candidate delivered another rock the rafters town hall meeting at gettysburg college in pennsylvania last friday just down the road from the site of picketts charge that ended the confederate advance north on day 3 of the battle of gettysburg but clinton still swept four of five primaries this week along with enough delegates to put the nomination virtually out of reach for the vermont senator but while sanders is already shifting gears away from winning the nomination to influencing the partys platform many of his supporters at the polling place on the gettysburg campus are still feeling bern and disappointed at the mounting prospect that clinton will be the nominee dana suitte who works for a printing company in gettysburg says she told her four sons to vote for sanders “i really like the fact that he wants to look at everything and change anything thats not working while clinton “comes off like a politician and “is just running on her history with nothing original to say “i think that she thinks that because a lot of black people voted for her husband they will automatically vote for her and thats not true says ms suitte who is black but her view could not change if clinton picked sanders as a running mate she says “i would love a woman to be president but i thought i wanted a little bit more from her “the only upside is bill clintons influence in the white house with her she adds “bill clinton was a really good president that would be my only confidence on the republican side it is the antiestablishment side that triumphed as donald trump ran the table with outsize wins in pennsylvania maryland delaware connecticut and rhode island many republicans now face what some see as an even tougher choice over whether to support trump a recent gallup poll finds that 51 percent of democrats have a favorable view of both clinton and sanders but only 28 percent of republicans have a favorable view of both the top two republican party candidates trump and sen ted cruz of texas robin williams beers a retired glass engraver who describes herself as a christian conservative attended a rally for ohio gov john kasich on the eve of tuesdays primary vote in rockville md she stakes out a front row seat with her home made signs including “resist the rage research think vote kasich in some respects she might seem a natural supporter for senator cruz or even trump who has drawn strong support from christian conservative voters in the south but she says that she had health issues at the start of the primary season and used her time in bed to read up on the candidates including governor kasichs account of the impact that bible study had on his life in his book “every other monday “i feel like he unifies people and our country desperately needs that right now she says she showed up at the polls in kingsville md at 6 30 am to post signs for kasich as a volunteer and took down the signs at 9 30 while at the polling venue “many people asked me who would be the best vote to stop trump she said in a phone interview after the vote could not she bring herself to vote for trump?

1350,by cameron day have you ever felt like you ended up in the wrong family? did you grow up feeling that you were so incredibly different from your parents and siblings that there must have been some sort of mistake for you to end up with those people? i m not talking about feeling out of place in the insanity of the current era of human society i m talking about something much deeper a sense that your very parents are not who you were meant to be born to if you have felt this way please keep reading as this may be very important information for you i have written at length about the ongoing battle to free humanity from the enslavement of the forces of darkness in articles like “ never call them archons “ first contact is not happening soon “ shifting into 2013 and many others the central theme of these articles is to illustrate that humanity is mired in multiple layers of illusion deception energy draining/harvesting trauma manipulation subjugation and much more while this is an incredibly beautiful planet the true beauty of humanity is being actively suppressed by forces that want to keep humans enslaved at the same time positively oriented guardians of free will have been working to free humanity from its energetic bonds of slavery while being careful to avoid creating further trauma within the enslaved populace how do you free slaves who believe they are already free? one of the many challenges to this undertaking is that people are repeatedly told that they are free that their government cares for them and that those ugly things like pollution and war are inevitable aspects of “the human condition more accurate would be to say that the conditioning and programming imposed on humans produces the horrors of abuse environmental destruction and war in order to show people how they have been enslaved and present them with alternative ways of living positively oriented beings from higher densities of creation chose to incarnate into human form in doing so the free will of humanity is not subjected to a new outside authority arriving and dispensing belief shattering truth upon the fragile minds of enslaved and abused humans instead positive social change begins to happen from within the race as awakening individuals point out the insanity of the “human condition and show others how to live in alignment with earth and natural laws this is an effective tactic although it is slow to produce change and is filled with risks due to the overpowered “veil of forgetfulness that is in operation on the planet the incarnating helper soul completely forgets their true identity takes on a human ego identity and risks the possibility that they may not awaken to the truth of their mission another risk is that the incarnating helper soul will experience severe traumas that prevent their awakening or worse that these traumas will orient their ego towards serving the darkness that they are fighting against despite all the risks many millions of brave souls have incarnated on this planet because we are soldiers who fight for the infinite source of all creation and because humanity is worth fighting for parachuting into a war zone many people don t fully realize it but this planet is a war zone and the battle is being fought mostly in the more subtle densities of the planet instead of in 3d with guns and bombs thats a good thing for the most part however for a helper soul from a higher density to “parachute into this war zone there is a major risk of “landing in the wrong incarnational vehicle (body) due to dark side interference when a being chooses the family they want to incarnate into they attach a filament of energy into the developing fetus this attachment allows them to stake their claim on the fetus so that they can enter the body more fully once it is close to being born or shortly after birth in a perfect world this process would proceed smoothly without interference on a war zone like earth this process can be disrupted the forces of darkness which i call ankle biters would prefer to never allow a helper soul to incarnate on their heavily controlled planet however they cannot stop us from entering so they use different tactics to attack the incoming helper soul one of their favorite methods is what i call the “birth bump the birth bump is usually done on the day the baby is being delivered because this is normally when the incarnating being comes much more strongly into the infant body during this time there is a window of opportunity for the dark forces to rip the original filament attachment from the intended body and attach it to a baby being born elsewhere on the same day the incarnating beings incoming energy follows their filament and ends up settling into a body and a birth family that they did not choose because this is a dark side attack the family that the incoming helper soul gets bumped into is selected based on their propensity for abuse neglect mistreatment lack of empathy and so on this allows the dark forces to effectively neutralize an incoming soldier for the true light without having to expend nearly as much time and energy on attacking that person as would be necessary if the helper soul had been born into a loving supportive home sometimes the gender of the body the being ends up in is different from what they had chosen creating even more confusion and difficulty for the incarnating being the bad parenting of the “pseudo parents serves as a source of constant torment for the infant helper soul and they grow up taking on the negative programming of their dysfunctional pseudo parents physical emotional mental and even sexual abuse all take their toll on the helper soul making their job of waking up getting clear and fighting against the forces of darkness vastly more difficult sometimes the pseudo parents aren t overtly abusive but are still a complete energetic mismatch to the helper soul as the child displays budding psychic abilities the parents will ridicule their perceptions or if the child is repelled by certain actions of the family they will be forced to conform to the familys normalcy biases essentially the pseudo parents continually attempt to coerce conformity from the helper soul child who they don t understand at all when the bumped helper soul grows up and begins the process of self clearing releasing their past gaining clarity and balance all it takes is a visit or phone call from their manipulative aggressive judgmental blaming pseudo parents to put them into a downward spiral of negativity from the dark forces perspective this is their most efficient strategy to combat the influx of helper souls onto planet earth it requires almost no energy output to impulse a darkness riddled pseudo parent to call their grown offspring and project a load of judgmental guilt ridden energy upon them conversely for the dark forces to psychically attack an individual requires much more time planning energy and resources eject! eject! the newly bumped helper soul upon realizing what has happened has a choice to make either “eject from this body and try to find a new one or stick it out with the hopes of overcoming the traumatizing childhood later on the ones who choose to “eject simply evacuate the body and it dies manifesting as “crib death or “sudden infant death syndrome where the otherwise healthy baby suddenly dies not all cases of crib death are from this unusual scenario but some of them are for the helper souls who are brave (or over confident) enough that they choose to stay life becomes a daily grind of feeling unloved alone unsupported abused and alienated their earthly home feels like a war zone where they can be attacked at any time for no reason where every action can be criticized and result in being berated or spanked (which is just a north carolina word for hitting a defenseless child) boys in this type of situation usually leave home as early as possible often before 18 years of age depending on the culture girls often try to get out by marrying as soon as possible or by going to study at a school far from home regardless of the gender or culture the drive to get away from the family is usually extremely strong this is often fodder for more guilt projection from the pseudo parents lamenting that their offspring “doesn t love them when in reality they are just trying to protect themselves from the toxic projections of their pseudo parents finding a safe distance along with healing and clearing the stored emotional pains of the past bumped helper souls need to energetically disconnect from their parents the more abusive and painful the childhood the more distance that is necessary this starts with living in a different town not calling too often and not allowing the parents to project their stuff onto you if you find yourself in a phone call where a wave of negativity is being projected onto you just say “i m not going to listen to this and hang up! energetically disconnecting from ones “bumped family can be tricky as they will often call after a major energetic disconnection event on some level they feel the disconnection and will attempt to pull you back into their dramas and energetic baggage this is where standing strong and refusing to engage their particular brand of craziness is essential please understand that i am only advocating that bumped helper souls create this distance from their dysfunctional and abusive families i do not advocate this for anyone who had normal non abusive families even if they don t really understand what you do as a helper soul what it actually means to establish a safe distance for those who were bumped into abusive families will differ from person to person creating your comfort zone for bumped helper souls how much distance from your pseudo parents you create is up to you and your higher self i would recommend a few things in this regard first don t waste too much of your time and energy trying to get your pseudo parents to admit what a bad job they did in raising you even if they do admit to some of their mistakes and apologize it won t alter their fundamental behavior and they will still push your same buttons when you talk to them second stop arguing with them about your own life choices on the phone or in person you have probably already tried that for years and gotten nowhere it is impossible to have real communication with a human being in a state of denial and guilt projection if a conversation starts to turn into an argument just end it and hang up or leave third do not let them come to your home make your home a sanctuary from the ills of the world especially your pseudo parents do or say whatever you need to keep them out of your home so that you can end any downward spiraling conversations by leaving the situation it is much easier for you to leave a place than to make someone leave your home fourth consider writing them a letter detailing their mistreatment of you and explaining why you are disconnecting from them a person can t interrupt a letter they just have to read it and attempt to deny things after the fact writing a letter like this can be a difficult experience that brings up old painful memories so make sure that you have done a lot of self clearing and healing before you go this route i usually only recommend this if you are going to also consider the next step as well fifth end all contact this is an extreme measure for extreme circumstances if the abuse you experienced as a child is still being perpetuated in various more subtle ways by the pseudo parents your best option to maintain your equilibrium is to end all contact with them this works best if you are living in a different town and have already begun creating distance be prepared for an onslaught of projected guilt and other forms of drama as they try to hang on and be firm in your convictions that you are not going to be dragged back into their dysfunctional world writing the letter to detail their past and present dysfunctional behavior will make it clear to them exactly why they are being cut off which will preempt any attempt for them to act like victims or project guilt and blame onto you they will be unable to utter anything like “after all we ve done for you if your letter is thorough and detailed the letter will make clear to them that “after all you ve done to me this is the end the art of forgiveness once you have established your safe boundaries and worked diligently on healing yourself there will come a point in your process where forgiveness is needed this forgiveness is for you and your own peace of mind it does not require that you call the pseudo parents and tell them that you are forgiving them or to reestablish contact with them if you have broken it off forgiveness occurs within your heart and mind and does not need to be spoken about in order to be effective for your own inner peace while your outward actions towards your pseudo parents will not change your inner perception will gradually shift as you incorporate forgiveness into your self clearing and healing efforts when you reach a “sticking point in your clearing process visualize them and say to them through your higher self “i forgive you for (that particular dysfunctional behavior) repeat it as many times as needed and allow your higher self to multiply the energy of your forgiveness so that it can clear out the frozen emotions and traumas within your subconscious mind more and more deeply the deeper purpose of this forgiveness is so that you can think about the pseudo parents or the events of your childhood without dropping into a low frequency state of depression despair victimization or hatred over time your inner perspective on the pseudo parents will shift and you will be able to understand how they came to be so dysfunctional which is usually from their own parents being abusive or neglectful when you can think of them simply as damaged human beings who deserve pity more than hate you will know that you are well on your way dropping the false ego identity it is vitally important that bumped helper souls release every aspect of the false sense of self that they were imprinted with during their traumatic childhood this is true for all light workers as well even those who had good parents a central part of the 3d incarnation mission is to transcend the ego identity formed in this lifetime and remember our real reason for being here then take action on that mission we didn t come here to support the matrix of illusions and lies to accrue fame or wealth of fiat currency we came here to render that entire paradigm obsolete by revealing the truth of the human being that humanity is a divine species that has been corrupted by darkness and evil and this must be acknowledged in order to heal our species wide trauma we came here to transform and rebuild the fragmented dna of our bodies to help others to do the same so that we can live in 3d vessels that reflect the divine inner self that is our true identity we came here to help the entire human race heal which means healing ourselves this is a monumental task to be sure and those of you who were bumped have even more work to do but you can do it you were strong enough to choose to ride out the roller coaster of a “bumped life and still fulfill your mission and you maintained that strength throughout the trials and tribulations of your childhood tap into that strength of will heal yourself clear the baggage out of your subconscious mind and begin working on your mission if you haven t already done so i urge you to work with the self clearing system level 1 and level 2 and make those clearing techniques part of your tool box the energy refund and reclaiming energy processes should be done daily to ensure that you are not energetically wrestling with your pseudo parents for childhood traumas use the “backpack of pain process in level 2 on a daily basis until you feel a significant lasting shift in your consciousness also use the “three galaxies process at the end of level 2 daily (with or without the recording) to keep your personal energy flowing smoothly you can transcend the traumas of your past if you are determined persistent patient and gentle with yourself always remember that who you really are is far more than this one single lifetime and that you can access the vast consciousness that is your true / higher / divine inner self to help you heal from the past most of all focus on loving yourself exactly as you are right now traumas and baggage included cultivate that love with your focus on the goal of being fully healed clear and filled with the light of your true divine inner self much love cameron day source wake up world.,FAKE

2238,valletta (reuters) daphne caruana galizia posted two items last monday on her popular blog one ridiculing maltas opposition leader for having rounded shoulders the other denouncing a senior government official as a crook a typical mornings work done she set off in her white peugeot 108 to run an errand but barely made it past her front gate before a bomb tore through the car throwing it into an adjacent field and killing her instantly her death shocked malta the smallest nation in the european union which has been engulfed by a wave of graft scandals including accusations of money laundering and influence peddling in government all of which have been denied caruana galizia exposed many of these cases and was loved by her readers as a fearless anti corruption crusader critics saw her as a muck raking fantasist prime minister joseph muscat her main target promised everything would be done to find her killers but friends and family have low expectations that anyone will be brought to justice seeing murky powers behind a very professional hit she had to be done away with because she couldn t be bought off said manuel delia a blogger who described the 53 year old caruana galizia as his mentor she was a polemicist a provocateur and a critic she was unique in malta a trail blazing journalist caruana galizia was one of maltas first political columnists in the 1990s at a time when its newspapers were staid and male dominated the confines of established media frustrated her and in 2008 she set up her blog running commentary a one woman operation which drew up to 400 000 page views a day matching the volumes recorded on the websites of the largest dailies she sometimes posted more than 30 items a day mixing caustic commentary with tabloid gossip and detailed graft allegations supplied by what she called her network of spies the blog allowed her to express herself exactly as she wanted and expose abuse wherever she saw it said petra caruana dingli a friend of the slain writer much of the criticism was leveled against muscat and his leftist labour party which won power in 2013 after a nearly quarter of a century of uninterrupted rule by the conservative nationalist party itself tainted by corruption scandals malta a rocky archipelago 100 km (60 miles) south of sicily with a population of 430 000 has no major soccer clubs or religious divisions instead people define themselves by their politics and caruana galizia was seen in the nationalist camp she denied being in anyones camp but said labour was turning malta into a mafia state something the party rejects she was a fierce labour critic but definitely not a fair critic said glenn bedingfield a labour parliamentarian she made very personal attacks over the way we looked the way we dressed she used to ridicule anyone associated with the labour party camp she was not kind she hurt a lot of people she could not also shake the party to its core last year in the so called panama papers she found muscats chief of staff and one of his ministers had panama registered companies she said they created the firms to hide bribes they denied wrongdoing this year she said she had proof muscats wife also owned a panama based company that allegedly received 1 dollars million from azerbaijan which has growing commercial ties with malta she denied the accusations as did muscat who instigated an investigation magistrates heard evidence from caruana galizia but have yet to release their findings muscat called snap elections for june saying he wanted a fresh mandate to prevent political uncertainty from damaging the economy the strongest performer in the european union critics such as caruana galizia say the economic success is fueled by schemes such as selling maltese passports to foreigners or handing out licences that have turned malta into the online gambling capital of europe the government says these initiatives are legitimate and voters returned muscat to office with a stable majority stunned by his victory caruana galizia halted work on her blog for a month to spend time with her three sons and take care of her much loved house and garden she returned in the summer with a surprise new target adrian delia who was looking to become leader of the nationalist party (np) some np supporters saw it as a betrayal and vilified her in social media people called her a hag a slut a witch said her friend caruana dingli it took its toll but she carried on regardless going where newspapers feared to tread caruana galizia accused delia of drawing money from a london based prostitution racket he denied this and filed five libel suits caruana galizia received 36 libel suits in the past nine months alone including 19 from a property developer while the economy minister persuaded the courts to freeze her bank account to ensure she could not pay up if she lost a case against him the libel suits were part of a wider strategy to shut her up said corinne vella one of caruana galizias three sisters they seemed to be designed to eat up her time and money caruana galizia came from a well to do family and her husband was a successful lawyer besides her blog she also edited a glossy magazine and wrote newspaper columns she was confident she would win the malta libel suits where in any case maximum damages total 11 647 euros (13728 dollars) four days after her killing police say they have made no arrests and predict it will take weeks to accumulate all the evidence i think people silence journalists not because of what they have written but because of what they are planning to write muscat told reuters in his office in valletta caruana galizias friends and family say they were not aware she had uncovered any explosive new stories i asked her if she had any more she told me isn t what i have got enough? said blogger manuel delia.,REAL

4126,(reuters) backers of democratic presidential contender bernie sanders have launched a campaign to win over some of his rival hillary clintons most prized supporters the superdelegates that can make the difference in a tight race for the partys nomination but some emails phone messages and petitions senator by the sanders boosters have backfired upsetting superdelegates with their aggressive tone and leading many to dig in their heels for clinton according to interviews conducted by reuters the drive to flip clintons super delegates has not been sanctioned by sanders campaign his spokesman michael briggs said “bernies campaign is focused on reaching out to all voters and earning delegates at primaries and caucuses he said in a statement stressing that the sanders campaign was not coordinating with supporters to contact superdelegates however the unofficial push could not complicate the us senator from vermonts efforts to woo the critical bloc in the coming months the effort has at times taken an angry tone some of the messages reviewed by reuters showed reflecting the anti establishment tinge of the 2016 presidential race where many voters are unhappy with washington insiders some 85 percent of the 4 763 delegate votes to the democratic national convention that will decide who will face a republican rival in the november election are determined by the results of states nominating contests but the remaining 15 percent are held by superdelegates who get to vote however they like meaning they could not hold the key to a tight contest superdelegates are made up of party leaders and elected senators members of congress and governors the democratic party adopted the system in the early 1980s as a way of giving party leaders more control over the nominating process though they have yet to play a decisive role in a nomination “the idea there is that you ve got people who have a long view who have arguably the best interests of the party at heart said terri fine a professor of political science at the university of central florida at least one superdelegate who has backed sanders however finds the system that can overturn the will of

not easily frightened framer told reuters “i m not going to change a vote over threats akilah ensley a north carolina superdelegate said she started hearing more often from sanders supporters after her name appeared on a wikipedia list noting her support for clinton “some of them were north carolina and some were rather abrasive she said adding “attacking my decisions is probably not the best way to change her mind luis heredia an arizona superdelegate for clinton said he has received over 30 phone calls emails and instant messages from sanders supporters “the majority of them are more

make you pay andres ramirez a political consultant in las vegas nevada and a superdelegate supporting clinton said in the past campaigns would typically try to soft sell their candidates rather than use pressure tactics “the way this has gone down in my experience has never happened before said while it is unclear who is directing some of the calls and emails to clintons superdelegates seattle resident justin renquist has pushed for some of the outreach although he stressed that such contacts needed to be civil renquist calls himself part of the “superdelegate task force army that rallies sanders supporters to reach superdelegates via facebook twitter and other means “there are 3 000 in my group who have been slamming these guys as politely and nicely as we canbasically saying look this system is undemocratic renquist said on friday the group issued a statement saying it did not support condone or engage in any communication with superdelegages that was “vulgar threatening

1165,many people believe that there has been a wave of individuals being born in order to change the old iron and industrial way of life to more enlightened and spiritual you ve probably heard about indigo children and lightworkers across the internet lightworkers are just a consequence the ways of the modern world have brought to the human psyche a lightworker is a person who can sense that there is a lot of healing to be done on a large scale to the world the modern ways of life are disharmonious and harmful to ourselves and nature which we are all a part of this results in subconscious awareness that something needs to be done especially in people who are born into the modern society newer generations are unbound from the chains people who were constructing the modern society have been imprisoned with the chains i am referring to are actually their investment of energy their mindset and character developed in a different era with far less available information these new generations can clearly see the bigger picture and what doesn t work thats why they have a heightened sense to fix the world just like there are popular terms in the science community addressing these new generations as generation x generation y and generation z there are terms in the spiritual movement addressing these generations as indigo children crystal children and rainbow children what kind of lightworker are you? check what kind of lightworker you are what aspect has most traits that describe you? indigo children born between the 1960s and the 1990s; rebellious and warrior in spirit; despises the system; loves to isolate; fond to addictions; stubborn; crystal children born between 1980s and 2000s; strong and pure hearted; highly developed imagination and creativity; extremely empathetic and emotional; passionate about supernatural phenomena and superheroes; easygoing; rainbow children born after the new millennium; positive and happy; technologically advanced and easy in understanding new gadgets; loving and hard to contain; loves animals nature and possibly vegan; free; this is what these labels mean indigo children are born between the 1960s and the 1990s really similar as the baby boomers of the generation x they are rebellious and unable to conform to dysfunctional situations at home work or school they are warriors in spirit they want to rage against the corrupted system that governs society and this trait projected itself into the art the music the movies the movements and the lifestyle of their youth they experimented with psychedelic substances they forced their mind to be opened all of this resulted in creation of new businesses and inventions that changed the future forever like the internet crystal children are most likely to be the children of people from generation x they are born around 1990s and 2000s slightly differing from generation y which addresses people born between 1980s and 2000s however the characteristics of crystal children and generation y individuals are almost exactly the same they are intuitive spiritually aware and passionate about supernatural subjects they have highly developed imagination and creativity they understand things easily they are extremely empathetic and very easy going this contradictive schism between their emotions forces them to use drugs to visit psychiatrists feel high levels of anxiety have panic attacks and sometimes even more serious issues with their mental health they are born in a transition time in a period where humanity made its biggest leap with technological advancement which affected all areas of society they grew up in times without internet and times when you cannot imagine how you lived without internet this transition happened in only 10 years period which is really small amount of time for such great change this affected their way of seeing the world it is like they were forced to raise their consciousness in an accelerated rate but thats ok because they are strong enough like crystals they always see the world with pure eyes which additionally adds to their crystal children description because of their imagination purity of heart and strength they are attracted to the superhero phenomena their art music movies businesses even their lifestyles are inspired and driven by various superheroes they idolized while they were growing up rainbow children are the newest generation of people or generation z born after the new millennium they are modern and more technologically advanced than generation x and y because they are raised in a period where humans are more connected than any time in the known human history they had almost all of the information in the world available to them while they were growing up only by pushing few buttons these kids are happy and positive they are like a breath of fresh air they are bringing happiness and joy to the whole world through various inventions platforms and mediums that the generation x has developed and generation y perfected their light and positivity makes them freer than any generation in modern history they love traveling they hate being tied up to one person and they cannot stand the old conformistic ways it feel like prison to them think of them like light; they give warmth life and cannot be captured their whole being is pure and thats why most of these kids are vegan the greatest difference between these 3 generations is this the indigos are here to destroy whats not working and pave the way for a better world the crystal children are the ones who need to create develop and build the new ways uniting the best from the old and the new the rainbow children are here to give life and fertilize the new and improved world thats in harmony with nature and the human potential all of these 3 spiritual archetypes need to work together so there will be a real change to the way humanity further develops however it doesn t mean that if you are an indigo you cannot be a crystal or a rainbow child you can evolve through all of these 3 archetypes depending on your environment understanding and purpose and a lot of people do these are simply 3 different aspects of one larger program called being a lightworker which works to heal the world here is how we are all a part of this spiritual revolution this spiritual revolution is a consequence of the collective human psyche to understand this you must understand how we are all connected you must grasp the fact that everything connects to everything else even our thoughts émile durkheim first introduced the collective conscious back in 1893 and described as the set of shared beliefs ideas and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society however just like our collective conscious carl june called a phenomena collective unconscious which is the subconscious mind shared by all of humanity this is how we are all connected this is how all of us unintentionally created the perfect environment for lightworkers to be developed and act as an antidote to the virus that could not have destroyed us maybe that was the defensive mechanism of our collective subconsciounsess or a higher plan of our collective psyche to help us thrive together as species life coach code source.,FAKE

us bombing in manbij and kobane in syria and ramadi and fallujah in iraq has resulted in thousands of civilian deaths and flattened entire neighbourhoods ; more than a third of us and uk backed saudi airstrikes in yemen have hit civilian sites including schools hospitals weddings and funerals talking about this is not meant as a distraction or relativization; the fact that the us and saudi arabia are engaged in similar activities does not make the bombing of aleppo less objectionable however it does raise questions about the motives of those pushing so hard for a no fly zone if western foreign policy actors and their allies in press were motivated by humanitarian concerns then surely stopping these atrocities should appear on the policy agenda especially given that the action required is easier and does not risk war with russia if humanitarian considerations were really the important factors in the foreign policy debate then there would be discussion on the legitimacy of aerial bombardment of cities and towns given that this invariably leads to civilian deaths international agreements have been successful in making chemical and biological weapons illegal a prohibition which is generally followed ( though not always ) the first well publicized use of aerial bombardment the nazi bombing of guernica in 1937 caused righteous popular outrage tragically however its use became normalized during the second world war and a ban on aerial bombing of cities was not included in the post war international settlement the fact that this seems so hopelessly idealistic reflects the fact that it is geopolitics not humanitarian considerations that govern international relations and foreign policy discussion; human suffering is nothing more than a useful pretext for whatever actions you want to take in order to secure geopolitical advantage the us and its allies want to remove syria from russias orbit so therefore the dictator there must go but airstrikes to support the dictator in yemen are fine because the dictator there is a friend of close us ally saudi arabia there is an added complication with the nfz in syria in that it marks a return to cold war era brinkmanship and possible armed confrontation with russia the logic of brinkmanship runs that to make geopolitical gains one must escalate to a level that will make the other side back down partly by convincing your enemy you are ready to commit irrational acts there is an inherent danger in this game both states are nuclear armed and the consequences of a spiral of escalation could not be devastating syria hawks or what close obama aide ben rhodes called the “ pro stupid shit caucus argue that a nfz will lead russia to effectively back down for example clinton argued that it will “give us leverage in our conversations with russia (interestingly in the exchange this quote from clinton indicated the war goal a nfz will make russia “put the assad future on the political and diplomatic track ie russia will be forced to accept regime change) after all despite the panic in the press russia is actually a feeble successor state to a superpower and would come off worse in a direct conflict with the preeminent might of north america or so the logic runs however dovish western foreign policy actors point to the danger that advanced russian materiel support to syria poses to the enforcement of a nfz unlike other recent us military adventures enforcing a nfz in syria could not lead to significant and politically unpalatable american casualties pilots will be shot down this realization means that saner establishment figures are opposed to a nfz for example us army general carter ham who oversaw the nfz in libya said a nfz is a “violent combat action that results in lots of casualties and increased risk to our own personnel instead relative doves like current secretary of state john kerry advocate intensifying the sanctions regime against syria and russia again this does not seem to be seriously about helping civilians a leaked un report has revealed that the existing western sanctions regime is preventing humanitarian aid and creating a humanitarian disaster that threatens to rival that caused by the oil for food program in iraq during the 1990s the history of sanctions tends to show that the costs are borne by civilians and a petersen institute study of all sanctions incidents since wwii shows that sanctions failed to achieve their goals in about ⅔ of cases and are even less successful when applied against enemies and autocrats so what is to be done? what should people in the west and globally push for to help the people of syria? unfortunately there do not seem to be any quick fixes the situation in syria is complex and involves diverse actors with competing interests immediate relief to the refugees fleeing the conflict should be a priority in terms of foreign policy campaigning for de escalation and diplomacy against constant militarism remain the best solutions for the syrian people and humanity generally.,FAKE

those making more than 1 dollars million a year to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent clinton has also called for an additional 4 percent tax on those making more than 5 dollars million annually

colleges and universities without incurring debt the committee for a responsible federal budget a nonpartisan nonprofit group that independently scored clintons proposals in their totality estimated her policies would cost 18 dollars trillion over the next decade and would be offset by 16 dollars trillion mostly generated by taxing high earners the group said the remaining 200 dollars billion could not be covered by 275 dollars billion in corporate tax revenue the clinton campaign has called for but not yet spelled out in sufficient detail for them to credit as an offset at this time

said she will defend executive actions taken by democratic president barack obama to defer deportations of children brought illegally to the united states and the parents of children who are citizens or legal residents she has said if congress does not pass comprehensive immigration reform she will similarly use executive action to defer deportations in “sympathetic cases a federal court has ruled

regulators additional authority to force institutions that pose high risks to break apart or reorganize clinton has also urged strengthening the volcker rule which restricts proprietary trading by commercial banks she has called for a new tax on high frequency trading and for stricter oversight of hedge funds private equity firms and other players in the so called shadow banking system she has promised stiffer policies on people who commit financial crimes including an extension of the statute of limitations on such crimes and a requirement for bank executives to return bonuses if their institutions suffer major losses changes to dodd frank have stalled in the republican controlled congress and it is unclear whether clinton could not get congressional backing to strengthen the law

strongholds in iraq and syria in a departure from the obama administration she supports the establishment of a no fly zone over syria and has called for an intensified air campaign by the us led

895,trumps comment that he has a winning temperament was the most tweeted moment of the debate pointing to the debates main theme democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton answers a question as republican presidential nominee donald trump listens during the presidential debate at hofstra university in hempstead ny on monday sept 26 2016 from the beginning of the 2016 presidential race donald trump has faced a nagging question does he have the right temperament to be commander in chief? hes brash hes entertaining hes thin skinned none of which disqualify him in the eyes of many voters from sitting in the big chair and making the big decisions but on monday night the republican presidential nominee faced the toughest test yet in his highly anticipated first debate against democrat hillary clinton could not he go toe to toe against an experienced political debater and come across as a plausible president? the bar was low and trump began the debate strongly the billionaire scored points against clinton on the economy jobs and trade we are losing our good jobs trump said reinforcing a theme that has propelled him to a commanding lead among non college educated white men and a virtual tie in the overall race but soon enough the temperament issue reared its head as trump began interrupting and at times shouting according to voxcom trump interrupted clinton 25 times in the first 26 minutes and by the end had interrupted her three times as often as she had interrupted him 51 to 17 finally the meta became the explicit when trump raised the issue of temperament himself i have much better judgment than she does he said talking about clintons vote for the iraq war as a senator there is no question about that i also have a much better temperament than she has you know? laughter rang out from audience despite debate ground rules that forbade audience reaction i think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament he said i have a winning temperament i know how to win she does not it was the most tweeted about moment of the debate according to hollywood reporter when i have the right temperament gets the biggest house laugh it is not going your way tweeted broadway star lin manuel miranda clinton soon came back to the topic when discussion turned to us iran relations and trumps statement last week that he would shoot iranian vessels out of the water if they bothered american ships that is not the right temperament to be commander in chief clinton said merriam webstercom reports that the exchange senator viewers to their dictionaries and that look ups of the word temperament spiked inquiries were 78 times higher than the sites usual hourly average but the meaning of temperament is easier sensed than described merriam websters definition is “the usual attitude mood or behavior of a person or animal that it seems could not mean anything in a political context a presidential temperament could not refer to prudence wisdom and restraint trumps outsize personality and his willingness to say things other politicians wouldn t dare has struck some voters as a breath of fresh air in an era when most politicians play it safe and speak in poll tested sound bites trumps rhetoric at times politically incorrect in his view set him apart from the rest of the republican party primary field and helped him to the partys presidential nomination but now hes playing for the presidency itself and his tone and comportment have emerged as major sticking points for some voters and there remain loyal republicans who would like to support their partys nominee but still aren t there yet voters trump needs to win in november one such voter richard bonomo a researcher at the university of wisconsin madison watched the debate closely but after it was over did not indicate a readiness to commit to trump trump held his own mr bonomo said in an email clinton did get in several very good points but her record of lying makes it difficult to accept uncritically just anything she says overnight polls showed clinton as the winner of the debate but post debate polls can be fleeting and don t predict the ultimate outcome of a presidential race it was a fiery debate that won t move a lot of votes says republican strategist ford o connell so all eyes will be focused on the second debate remember voters are grading the candidates differently trump has the momentum in the polls and therefore he just has to be plausible in the oval office which he was still he acknowledges that clinton scored points noting how she put trump on the defensive about his refusal to release his tax returns and on birtherism trumps longtime questioning of whether president obama was born in the united states which he only recently said was a settled issue the good news for trump is that he went toe to toe with secretary clinton on the debate stage which elevated his legitimacy as a candidate something especially crucial when you are the challenger party candidate mr o connell said as we move on to the second debate look for both candidates to tweak their tactics particularly trump indeed trumps biggest failing in the debate may have been his many missed opportunities he didn t go after clinton for calling half of trump supporters a basket of deplorables he also skipped the clinton foundation benghazi and clintons ties to wall street clinton for her part can be expected to continue to pound trump on his range of vulnerabilities including his temperament his business record and his comments about women and minorities in the business world half of the money spent on marketing is wasted; we just don t know which half says david redlawsk chairman of the political science department at the university of delaware newark it is the same with information flows in a campaign we know they matter somewhere but it is hard to know which matter.,REAL

cedar rapids iowa in 2015 over the months clinton misstated key facts about her use of private email and her own server for her work as secretary of state the departments inspector general reported this week over the months hillary clinton misstated key facts about her use of private email and her own server for her work as secretary of state the departments inspector general reported this week according to the findings she claimed approval she didn t have and declined to be interviewed for the report despite saying i m more than ready to talk to anybody anytime scrutiny of her unusual email practices appeared to be unwelcome despite her contention those practices were well known and fully above board a look at some of clintons past claims about her unusual email set up and how they compare with the inspector generals findings clinton the system we used was set up for president clintons office and it had numerous safeguards it was on property guarded by the secret service and there were no security breaches march 2015 press conference the report evidence emerged of hacking attempts though it is unclear whether they were successful on jan 9 2011 (asterisk)an adviser to former president bill clinton notified the state departments deputy chief of staff for operations that he had to shut down the server because he suspected someone was trying to hack us and while they did not get in i did nt (sic) want to let them have the chance to later that day he senator another note we were attacked again so i shut (the server) down for a few min the following day the deputy chief emailed top clinton aides and instructed them not to email the secretary anything sensitive also in may 2011 clinton told aides that someone was hacking into her email after she received a message with a suspicious link the new audit report said the associated press has previously reported that according to detailed records compiled in 2012 clintons server was connected to the internet in ways that made it more vulnerable to hackers it appeared to allow users to connect openly over the internet to control it remotely moreover it is unclear what protection her email system might have achieved from having the secret service guard the property digital security breaches tend to come from computer networks not over a fence clinton what i did was allowed it was allowed by the state department the state department has confirmed that ap interview september the report no evidence that clinton asked for or received approval to conduct official government business on a personal email account run through a private server in her new york home according to top state department officials interviewed for the investigation the departments that oversee security did not and would not approve her use of a personal account because of security concerns clinton has changed her account since the report came out on thursday she told cnn i thought it was allowed i knew past secretaries of state used personal email colin powell was the only secretary of state who used personal email for work but not to the extent she did and he did not use a private server clinton it was fully above board everybody in the government with whom i emailed knew that i was using a personal email ap interview september clinton the people in the government knew that i was using a personal account the people i was emailing to on the dot gov system certainly knew and they would respond to me on my personal email nbc news interview september the report according to the findings it is unclear how widespread knowledge was about clintons use of a personal account though clintons use of a private email was discussed with some in her agency senior department officials who worked for her including the undersecretary responsible for security said they were not asked to approve or review the use of her private server the officials also said they were unaware of the scope or extent of her email practices even though clinton exchanged hundreds of thousands of messages with people in government from her personal account clinton in the fall i think it was october of last year (2014) the state department senator a letter to previous secretaries of state asking for help with their record keeping in part because of the technical problems that they knew they had to deal with and they asked that we all of us go through our e mails to determine what was work related and to provide that for them nbc news september the report while it is true that the state department requested records from former secretaries of state in november 2014 the report says the department raised concerns about clintons compliance with federal record keeping laws years earlier and the attention did not appear welcome two employees in the office of information resources management discussed concerns about her use of a personal email account in separate 2010 meetings one of the employees stressed in one of the meetings that the information being transmitted needed to be preserved to satisfy federal records laws they were instructed by the director of the department never to speak of the secretarys personal email system again according to the report clinton i think last august i made it clear i m more than ready to talk to anybody anytime cbs news interview in may the report clinton declined through her lawyer to be interviewed for the report four other secretaries of state participated john kerry madeleine albright condoleezza rice and colin powell she now says everything i had to say was out there but she has said she will speak to the fbi as part of a separate criminal investigation into possible security breaches related to her private server in october she testified about the

3623,canton ohio (reuters) if donald trump wins the republican party nomination his path to the white house will run through this working class city with a knack for picking presidents no republican has ever won the white house without ohio and nowhere better reflects the challenges and opportunities trump faces in his 2016 presidential quest than canton a once booming industrial city that like ohio and the rest of americas rust belt is going through profound economic and demographic change canton a gritty northeastern ohio city where the once dominant steel industry has been in decline for 20 years is the heart of stark county a political bellwether that save twice has picked every winning presidential candidate since 1964 the real estate moguls primary wins in michigan and in mississippi on tuesday in the face of blistering attacks from the partys establishment expanded his lead in the white house nominating race and demonstrated his broad appeal across many demographic groups in the republican party but here in predominately white canton the birthplace of professional american football he will need to show cross over appeal in the general election and win over not just republicans but working class democrats and some independents to beat a democrat illustrating the challenge he will face in ohio and potentially other midwestern “rust belt states a more immediate test looms next week in the states republican primary where polls show trump narrowly leads ohio governor john kasich who casts himself as a pragmatic statesman like alternative to trump if trump wins ohio and florida states rich in the delegates who select their partys nominee at julys republican national convention he would almost certainly lock up his partys nomination sitting in a steel workers meeting at their canton union hall curtis green the chapters vice president described trumps support among a growing number of members as their “dirty little secret “i view him as a radical and a racist and i don t want to be affiliated with that green said “but if you say what you mean a lot of guys see that in trump and they respect that he doesn t dance around the issues he takes them head on there are a fair amount of our members who do support donald trump if trump just wins the states that republican nominee mitt romney won in 2012 he would have only 206 electoral college votes short of the 270 needed to win the white house the fight over electoral college votes has turned recent elections into pitched battles over a dozen or so states ohio is often at the center the state which has not voted for the loser in a presidential election since 1960 is seen as a microcosm of american swing voters from culturally conservative “reagan democrats who defected from their party to support republican ronald reagan in the 1980s to suburban soccer moms and upwardly mobile hispanics to offset the growing proportion of blacks and hispanics in the voting age population trump must turn white voters out in greater numbers than romney in cities such as canton his performance in primary states where democrats and independent can vote as well as republicans suggests trump could not attract large numbers of these voters in a general election reuters interviews here with more than two dozen voters show why in this city of 72 500 people trumps denunciation of free trade political correctness and illegal immigrants is resonating among some traditionally democratic blue collar steel workers “the labor unions who usually support the democrats a lot of our members and a lot of their families are supporting trump said keith strobelt a political director for the united steelworkers local union in canton strobelt does not support trump cantons local united steelworkers union has 1 800 members down from 6 700 at its peak 30 years ago its leadership has not officially endorsed a candidate thought it has praised democrat senator bernie sanders some rank and file members however say they better identify with trumps broadsides against illegal immigration and tirades against trade with china and mexico “it could not be that several hundred of our members will back trump strobelt said “a lot find him refreshing he says a lot of things they say around their dinner tables but in a general election trump faces formidable odds in canton as he does across ohio and the midwest canton and the region is changing in ways that favor democrats reflecting the republican partys broader problems with a us electorate that is becoming less white and less culturally conservative in 2000 canton was nearly 75 percent white with an african american population of 20 percent and an hispanic population of just over 1 percent its biggest employer was the timken company a giant ball bearing and high custom steel manufacturer that was the dominant economic force in canton for much of the 20th century by 2010 according to census data canton was 69 percent white its black population had increased by 3 percent its hispanic residents to nearly 3 percent tuesdays primary in neighboring michigan showed how volatile this election has become with trumps potent appeal among disaffected whites stretching beyond the south in the democratic race sanders won most of the states white working class countryside and small towns in an upset over front runner hillary clinton in canton like elsewhere in the “rust belt heartlands stretching from the midwest to the great lakes region and parts of the northeast manufacturing has been hollowed out since the 1970s due in part to foreign competition in 1990 ohio had over 1 million manufacturing jobs; today just 680 000 according to the us bureau of labor statistics ohio has shed nearly 200 000 manufacturing jobs since the 2007 2009 great recession a different type of worker more white collar and upscale has moved into the canton area the top two employers are now the aultman hospital and mercy medical center highly competitive health care providers “while trump might pick up blue collar democrats and older folks who are disillusioned with the political process the flip side is he could not lose more upper status voters in ohio said john green a political science professor at the university of akron close to canton “republican party leaders in ohio are wringing their hands there is a perception that trump helps among blue collar voters but could not alienate white collar voters january timken the vice chair of the stark county republican party and the wife of timkensteels chief executive said the local party was encountering people who had never voted republican before but were supporting trump but she said there was concern trump might turn off other voters especially independents who account for one fifth of ohios voters there is no polling to predict which way canton and stark county will vote in novembers general election but after a long era of mixed local government the city council after elections last year is now made up of entirely democratic party members although the current mayor a former democrat won office as an independent in canton there are nearly 6 000 voters registered as democrats compared to just over 1 100 republicans according to the stark county board of elections in 2006 there were 12 000 registered democrats and 4 400 republicans democratic strategists say that despite the demographic changes trump could not still prevail march anne marsh a democratic strategist cites trumps dominant performance in the republican primary in massachusetts on march 1 although not a rust belt state trump won big in heavily blue collar union cities “trump put together a coalition in massachusetts that elects democratic

370,if you want to know why saturdays nevada caucus has suddenly in its final weeks turned from a presumed landslide for hillary clinton into a total toss up ask emily sandoval and maggie salas crespo or rather don t it is not that they re uninformed; both sandoval and salas crespo are politically engaged (they work for a small political consulting firm) and are closely following the democratic primary but as of last week at least they were still in the uncomfortable position of not having made up their minds that is a very good question sandoval said squirming salas crespo nudged her you go first and sandoval sighed i m a little broken between bernie and hillary she said she struggled to explain why but her friend eric did it for her it is a struggle of head versus heart hillary clinton wasn t supposed to have to fight this hard for their votes their generational peers in iowa and new hampshire voted overwhelmingly from bernie sanders but they weren t expected to follow suit instead the clinton campaign expected nonwhite voters (latinos in nevada and black voters in south carolina) to provide hillary with a couple of easy wins after getting shellacked by sanders in blindingly white new hampshire thats not happening the race in nevada is north carolina and north carolina heading into saturdays caucuses and available polling suggests nonwhite voters are split between sanders and clinton young latinos who make up nearly half of nevadas latino voters don t have the rosy memories of the 1990s that helped drive clinton to victory with latinos across the country (including in nevada) in 2008 instead the president on their mind is obama they re still wrestling with his failure to keep his campaign promise to pass immigration reform and the record deportations of his first term but while they re not inclined to fall in line behind a candidate that represents the political establishment that disappointed them many are equally wary of falling in love with another candidate who promises to transform the political order the weight of choosing a candidate is heavy because in this as in all politics many young latinos carry the responsibility of choosing a candidate on behalf of their relatives and community members who can t vote in the days leading up to the caucuses they were still struggling to figure out who could not be entrusted to protect them and the ones they love several latino and immigration advocacy groups have been pushing the trump effect the idea that donald trump has attracted so much attention for saying offensive things about immigrants that it will mobilize record numbers of latinos to the polls to vote against him that might be true with mr t in the mix it has sparked a lot more interest says salas crespo i have family members who ve been legal permanent residents [green card holders] for 30 years who had never thought of becoming citizens and voting now they re thinking about it salas crespo herself is part of a younger generation latinos under 30 whom university of nevada las vegas professor david damore describes as more politically engaged as compared to prior generations they make up nearly half of nevadas latino voters and many of them didn t need the trumpian wake up call furthermore saturdays caucuses throw into relief that it is not enough to vote against a candidate latinos can t vote against trump on saturday and no one i spoke with in nevada was inclined to caucus with the republicans to block him instead latino voters are looking assiduously for someone to vote for some of them have found it both the sanders and clinton campaigns have made significant efforts to reach out to latino voters of all ages sanders has a core of young latino volunteers who his campaign hopes will rally their community to a caucus victory and there is definitely some enthusiasm for clinton as well michael gonzalez a voter registration organizer says there are plenty of people who complete their registration forms hand them back to him and shout hillary! as they walk away from his clipboard but most of the young latinos i talked to in nevada weren t yet able to get fully behind either candidate my biggest fear says jocelyn sida of the civic engagement group mi familia vota is that the mentality of latinos is going to be all about broken promises don t trust any candidate or campaign and just vote for the sake of it i want them to vote with purpose i want them to vote to support candidates and issues they re passionate on but sidas reference to broken promises is right on for many especially for young latinos many of whom came of political age during the obama administration the outgoing president is associated with the promise he made then broke on immigration reform as well as the deportations that took place in its stead when president obama went into office he was talking about immigration reforms says local activist and sanders supporter liz hernandez but still in 2016 i live in fear for my parents knowing that at any time they could not be deported i m not saying obama hasn t done anything for us hernandez continues she herself got protection from deportation and work eligibility after obamas 2012 executive actions but that does not mean that i cannot be critical of the deportations that are happening now hernandez can t vote but both citizens and noncitizens i spoke to in nevada agreed members of the community who can vote bear the responsibility of voting on behalf of those who cannot young latinos take this responsibility especially seriously in a way that makes them less partisan than their older peers in 2014 asked why they voted by the polling firm latino decisions latinos as a whole were only slightly more likely to say they were voting to represent the community (37 percent) as to support the democratic party (34 percent) but among latinos under 35 only 28 percent said they d come out to support democrats; 50 percent nearly twice as many were voting on the communitys behalf so which of the two democrats running for president if either deserves to be entrusted to protect the latino community? this is the question lurking behind the pre nevada caucus uncertainty and plenty of latinos simply aren t inclined to trust anyone people right now they doubt a lot of the candidates because of the last eight years says hernandez it is not that people are totally disengaged they re proactive in their skepticism using it to test the candidates people are more focused on actual actions on how they voted being more skeptical in some cases that skepticism is extending to the democratic party as a whole a lot of latino voters are inclined to vote republican this year more than 2008 diaz says at least to vote for republicans who are more non conservative on the other end of the spectrum aldo chavira a unlv student who wears bernie! pins on his shirt and backpack says he might not bother to vote for the democratic nominee if it isn t sanders i feel like there isn t much difference between the parties now if he didn t win the nomination that d be one of the last times that you could not vote for somebody honest liz hernandez doesn t go so far as to say that both parties are the same but she also believes sanderss anti establishment cred makes him the anti political politician latinos are seeking because he offers hope diaz sees it differently that falling in love with sanders is making the same mistake all over again when i hear bernie sanders talk about certain immigration points it reminds me of obama like i ve heard that before i want to hear something different of course it is hard to judge candidates based on their actions in the midst of a presidential candidacy which is all about words but some latinos are making their decisions based on how well they feel the candidates are reaching out to their community how much in other words their vote and input is being valued because of outreach i m leaning toward clinton says diaz i feel like shes been trying to keep people more involved on the other hand another young latina who asked not to be named said that she d only been contacted on behalf of the sanders campaign by a woman who spoke in passionate and fluent spanish it was amazing! alternatively they can judge by how well the candidates respond when they re called out for their inevitable shortcomings we always have to be vigilant says astrid silva of the group dream vegas silva isn t eligible to vote but shes endorsed hillary clinton we gave her a lot of the criticisms we had and of all the candidates she handled it the best most young latinos don t have the luxury of sitting down and grilling the candidates but silvas attitude of engaged skepticism is pretty common among her peers i work a lot with the youth says emily sandoval searching for the right euphemism she adds you see more of an innocent essence in what they would like to see in this country in a primary election thats been defined by a generation gap as much as anything else you might associate that sort of pragmatism with the over 45 voters drawn to hillary clinton sandoval who was undecided as of last week is in her mid 20s she has only voted for one president before but paying close personal attention to the obama administrations failures and limitations over the past eight years has made her especially wary of candidates who appeal to her heart freddy garcia is even younger he really is one of those first time voters at a mock caucus on saturday he was also undecided saying he had to do some research on the candidates immigration positions before making up his mind when his fellow mock caucus attendee also a latino and first time voter declared his support for sanders he started evangelizing not so subtly to garcia the actual mock caucus hadn t started yet and it was using fake candidates anyway but garcia was getting a taste of the real caucus it is time for change the sanders supporter said people keep saying hes not going to do that change but they re the naysayers if you believe the change it will happen garcia sighed literally every candidate in history has promised change he said he sat sideways in his chair turning his back to the evangelism.,REAL

1081,rome us democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders met privately with pope francis on saturday the capstone to an unusual detour from the american election sanders said the meeting was for personal reasons and does not constitute an endorsement from the holy see i am an enormous fan of the pope because i think he has played a transformative role in the world in talking about issues that very rarely get the kind of discussion they deserve sanders said in an interview aboard his chartered plane whether it is income and wealth inequality whether it is what he calls the dispossessed the young people the old people the unemployed people who are on the sidelines of society whether it is the ideology of greed whether it is need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to save the planet he has been a transformative leader and he is a very beautiful man sanders continued when you meet him you see something very very special in his face he is a man of peace and you see that some of sanderss advisers including his wife january also were at the meeting he said that there was no discussion of his underdog candidacy or the election there was no photograph of the brief meeting at the papal residence complex in keeping with vatican protocol and also sanders said to make clear that there is no endorsement here francis on saturday made it clear that his meeting with sanders was not political saying that those who thought it was should “look for a psychiatrist according to reuters the pontiff met sanders at the vatican guest house where the pope lives “when i came down i greeted him i shook his hand and nothing more this is called good manners and it is not getting involved in politics reuters says the pope told reporters during an answer to a question aboard the plane returning from the greek island of lesbos where he visited a refugee camp [pope calls for compassion for refugees takes three families back to italy] “if anyone thinks that greeting someone is getting involved in politics i recommend that he look for a psychiatrist he reportedly said while laughing sanders was at the vatican participating in a seminar on income inequality and economic justice at the pontifical academy of social sciences where he was invited to attend as well as speak he and other conference invitees spent the night at the vatican after the conference the trip suggests that sanders is looking ahead to how he would continue and expand the focus on very liberal social justice issues that has defined his candidacy in a matter of months he moved from gadfly to serious challenger to the longtime democratic favorite largely on the strength of a set of ideas more common to liberal university campuses than the political debate stage if elected president i certainly would look forward to working with the pope in trying to create a moral economy which was the theme of this conference; an economy which challenges the idea that greed has got to be the dominant force in the worlds economy sanders said and if he loses? well the ideas and the efforts remain the same i m a united states senator from vermont and i ll continue to fight the fights that i ve always fought with a larger platform to do so sanders said the vatican invitation is symbolic of that platform he agreed but sanders and the pontiff share many goals for social justice and economic restructuring and sanders suggested that and not his candidacy was the reason for the audience with francis the speech that i gave yesterday would have been the speech 10 years ago long before i ever dreamed of running for president he said in an interview with the washington post sanders said the trip was absolutely a worthwhile diversion from campaigning in new york where he trails front runner hillary clinton by double digits in most polls look we have campaigned extraordinarily hard in new york sanders said he claimed he has addressed 96 000 people across the state at rallies and other meetings we have worked very hard and when we go back we are gonna work hard this was an invitation that i would never have forgiven myself if i had refused sanders needs a solid showing in new york which offers more than 200 delegates to maintain a plausible argument that he can catch up to clinton his path to the nomination has grown narrower even as he has defeated clinton in a string of contests over the past month uh we got a shot sanders said when asked about his prospects for tuesdays primary vote it is gonna be tough for us not just because clinton has won two elections there but because of the nature of the voting rules new york which clinton represented as a senator for eight years allows only registered democrats to vote in the democratic primary meaning independents are cut out sanders has been regularly defeating clinton among independents the state also does not allow same day registration sanders said he disagrees with both rules those are the rules they don t work for us sanders said but nonetheless if there is a large voter turnout we got a shot to win this sanders flew to rome on a large chartered airliner largely paid with campaign funds spokesman michael briggs said he said he did not know the exact cost of the trip news organizations flying with sanders pay for their passage and the secret service also pays a share sanders has taken some criticism earlier in his campaign for using chartered aircraft a luxury for the privileged class as well as an addition to carbon emissions while railing against the excesses of the wealthiest top 1 percent of americans several of sanderss advisers along with his wife their four children and four of their grandchildren accompanied him for the overnight visit to rome while january sanders attended the conference with her husband and joined him in meeting the pope the rest of the family spent time sightseeing the trip also included a stay at a posh hotel sanders was back on the plane saturday as he plans to campaign in brooklyn in the evening stefano pitrelli in rome contributed to this report.,REAL
969,donald trump is an unusual candidate who does a lot of unusual things for example after flubbing a debate performance in which he appeared volatile irritable and uninformed about key issues he did not attempt to refocus his campaign on proven message points or topics where he has a firm grasp of talking points instead hes been lashing out at alicia machado while using apophasis to bring up bill clintons marital infidelity by saying hes not talking about bill clintons marital infidelity it seems like a bad strategy because it almost certainly is in fact a bad strategy but not everyone sees it that way in certain quarters there is a tendency to assume that trump is crazy like a fox jon favreau barack obamas chief speechwriter for much of his career in national politics sees the post debate binge in that light ken baer a veteran democratic party operative even believes that trumps feud with the khan family was a successful effort to distract attention from a bread and butter economic critique of trump this view gives trump far too much credit all available evidence suggests that trump is a poor candidate waging a poor campaign and blowing a very winnable race against a democratic party nominee who is herself relatively weak the presumption that trump is performing well is based on a misreading of the underlying fundamentals of the election and in its own terms arguably does a little bit to boost his electoral fortunes by cloaking his campaign in an undeserved shroud of competence the overwhelmingly probable conclusion is that trump does things that don t seem to make sense because he is a political neophyte who doesn t know what he is doing the core fact about donald trumps general election campaign is that it is been singularly ineffective not only is he down in the polls right now but hes been consistently down in the polls for virtually the entire breadth of the campaign that doesn t mean trump “can t win or that clinton has nothing to worry about but it does mean that as best we can tell trump started behind and has never really found a way to get ahead and hes been losing even though clinton has been viewed more unfavorably than favorably since april a bad dynamic that set in for her before the democratic primary wrapped up people tend to discount the “trump is losing factor on the grounds that he “should be doing worse but this becomes circular trumps weakness as a candidate is the only reason to expect him to lose he is in fact losing because he is in fact running a bad campaign the reality is that the underlying fundamentals of the race a two term president leaving office amidst paltry economic growth favor a republican victory thats what voxs “trump tax model says but don t take our word for it harry enten at fivethirtyeight thinks the same thing as does lynn vavreck at the upshot and john sides at the monkey cage yet despite favorable fundamentals trump has been consistently behind in the polls leading in broad averages only for a couple of days between the two parties conventions not only has trump been consistently losing despite favorable fundamentals but hes been consistently losing despite the luxury of running against an opponent with an underwater favorability rating conversely the fundamentals in the 2012 election favored obama mitt romney did slightly better than might be expected given the fundamentals and ran ahead of the republican party senate nominee in basically every state thats about what you would expect if you think of romney as a handsome telegenic successful businessperson who governed as a moderate in a blue state before remaking himself as a conventional republican obamas attacks on romney seem to have had replacement level effectiveness at best and still left romney better regarded than a typical conservative republican one source of confusion is that overall economic conditions are clearly better today than they were four years ago history teaches us that what matters politically is short term rates of change not levels of prosperity economic conditions are better in 2016 than they were in 2012 but growth was faster four years ago than it is today when things seem to have leveled off after a north carolina 2015 to make a long story short donald trump is the republican party nominee in a year when a generic republican would be favored to beat a generic democrat rather than running against a generic democrat he is running against an unusually unpopular democrat and he is losing of course the mere fact that trumps overall campaign is ineffective doesn t mean that every particular choice he makes is bad but it does mean that there is no particular reason to give him the benefit of the doubt the big lesson of the 2016 campaign is that the fundamentals matter a lot the electorate is polarized and so even a really bad candidate has a high floor clinton has major weaknesses in terms of weak economic growth and voter fatigue with democratic party leadership (manifesting in 2016 largely in millennial disaffection with clinton even as young voters eschew trump) these factors keep trump perennially within striking distance; it is a very winnable election for him but instead of winning he is losing and he has been consistently losing because he doesn t know what hes doing.,REAL
3491,21st century wire says several people have been shot at the bronx lebanon hospital center as an allegedly disgruntled ex family medicine doctor opened fire with an m16 type rifle later reported to be an ar 15 inside the facility early reports state that as many a seven were injured in the shooting with at least two people dead at the scene including the shooter interestingly early reports suggested that there may have been multiple shooters involvedthe motive for the tragic shooting is the still under investigation the gunman is said to be 45 year old dr henry michael bello who is believed to have resigned in 2015 over sexual harassment allegationshowever some confusion has emerged as to what really happened at the scene active shooter the bronx lebanon hospital center took part in an active shooter preparedness forum in june of 2016 (photo illustration 21wires shawn helton)nbc news reported the following developments shortly after the apparent shooting the shooter has been identified as dr henry michael bello a 45 year old family medicine doctor formerly employed at the hospital according to sourcesafter shooting the victims many of them if not all doctors bello tried to set himself on fire on the 17th floor of the hospital o neill said the hospitals fire alarm system activated and fdny firefighters were on standby outside the hospital as nypd executed its active shooter protocol by the time police found bello on the 17th floor he was dead of self inflicted gunshot wound o neill saida motive in the shootings remains unclear but authorities say there is no apparent nexus to terror sources say bello resigned from the hospital in 2015 in lieu of being fired circumstances in the resignation weren t clear as members of the nypds most armed units responded to the active shooter situation a sea of patrol and tactical vehicles gridlocked the streets around the hospital on grand concourse and police surveyed the roof of the building with their guns drawn chopper 4 over the scene shows note other reports have suggested it took about 15 minutes from the first 911 call until bellos body was discovered deadalso shortly after the shooting rampage started reuters reported the police were able to conduct a sweep essentially shutting down the building attack police searched the hospital room by room urging occupants to turn off the lights and remain in place as they conducted the sweep according to an account posted on twitter by felix puno who identified himself as patient in the radiology department on the fourth floor of the hospital building is in complete shut down i was in the middle of getting an x ray when security alerted us to the active shooter situation puno tweetednew york mayor bill de blasio was briefed on the shooting and was on his way to the scene the mayors twitter account said drill protocol a hospital staff member follow the obligatory hands up protocol as part of the scripted active shooter scenario training (image source nydailynews) sketchy detailsas with any traumatic event there often several are certain details that don t quite add upwhile we versus been told the shooting took place on the 16th floor of the building some reports gave eye witness testimony to the contrary with one stating he heard three gun shots while located on the 10th floor is it really possible he heard gun shots from 6 stories above? heres nbc again with that detail francisco bodon a patient at bronx lebanon tells nbc new york sister station telemundo 47 that he was in a room on the 10th floor when three gunshots rang out and then chaos eruptedthere may have been more than three [shots] but people were screaming crying and running around it was very chaotic said bodon adding to the confusion the uks express reported that one of doctors who was wounded in the shooting as people inside the hospital created a makeshift tourniquet out of an emergency fire hosealthough bello reportedly held a work place grudge and apparently made threats to coworkers the hospital officials said none of the victims were connected to bello question considering the massive amount of training associated with the hospital why was there no zero tolerance active shooter plan in place something commonly implemented in emergency prep?over the years we versus seen how sensationalized shooting events have become a staple part of our day to day lives complete with ready made political talking points and staged press conferences a buffet laid out for america all of this within minutes or hours of high profile tragedy massive response this kind of police emergency response has become routine after many high profile active shooter incidents (image source nbcdfwcom)the precarious relationship between emergency preparedness drills and actual active shootings is an ongoing pattern present in many high profile shooting incidents in recent years with mass shootings happening at the exact same locations as where active shooter or terrorism drills had just previously taken place a puzzling trend which we have covered extensively at 21wire this latest bronx lebanon hospital center appears to be no exceptionalthough the bronx lebanon hospital center appears to be work place violence it is important to examine other aspects or elements surrounding any casebelow is a screen shot depicting speakers that participated in an active shooter planning forum in conjunction with the healthcare association of new york state in june of 2016 the bronx lebanon hospital center is displayed among those speaking in addition to active shooter emergency planning protocols listed above according to a fojp service corporation journal bronx lebanon hospital was selected be a part of major emergency prep since at least over the past several years heres a passage from that report at bronx lebanon hospital center the department of safety is charged with multiple responsibilities some of which include but are not limited to fire and life safety general safety and monitoring the fire command station; and coordinating emergency management and response planningcontinuing the report outlined the following at bronx lebanon we took our environment into account for example geographic location we are in and let that be our driving force to how we developed our hazard vulnerablity analysis (hva) and put our emergency action plan (eap) together with two main campuses and multiple satellite locations our plan has to incorporate everyone to ensure we will have the necessary staff in case of emergencies it is interesting that a hospital known to have extensive emergency protocols could not have a shooting occur on its own premises after leading the area charge in addressing that very issuequestion is it really just a coincidence that this hospital was so heavily involved in active shooter prep only to fall prey to exactly that kind of tragedy?*update* according to new reports as per active shooter protocol first responders ducked for cover as patients filed from bronx lebanon hospital wearing bed sheets wouldn t the answer here be to properly train those in the work place how to handle a firearm in crisis situations such as this?additionally sources tell cbs2 bello started two fires one at the nurses station and another as an attempt to set himself ablaze he ended up shooting himself in a room then staggered out to the hallway where he died continuing the article goes on to state the following police continue to investigate the rampage the new york daily news reports bello senator them an email before the shooting where he wrote about leaving his job at the hospital question if bellos email prior to the shooting was threatening in nature then why wasn t he taken in for police questioning?this whole aspect to the bronx lebanon hospital case appears to echo some of what happened in 2013 when tv shooter vester flanagan aka bryce williams had also warned a manager that there would be negative consequences for his firing and vowed he would make a stink and it is going to be in the headlines here we see a similar foreshadowing of tragedy prior to yet another suspicious shooting case that was also linked to an active shooter drill before a bizarre shooting rampageheres another look at a tweet from the wdbj tv shooting case in 2015 that documents the active shooter drill connection heres a collection of media montages and video footage supposedly depicting the bronx lebanon hospital center shooting response as staff and others sheltered in place notice the makeshift barricade during active shooter training the run and hide method is a critical feature in crisis roleplay as those in the hospital were ordered to shelter in place by both the nypd and at the urging of the consulate for the united arab emirates while there were several tweets posted to twitter regarding the incidenthere is a screenshot first published by new york city alerts that allegedly depicts the dead gunman bello notice there is no evidence of fire that can been seen question what was the purpose of releasing this photo or than to sensationalize a tragic event?heres a social media post with a comment that read stayed safe during the crisis by a page since taken down on instagram heres the witness who heard shots ring out while on the 10th floor in the aftermath of any of these crisis events in america powerful interests are always quick to line up and take advantage of the event mounting their sociopolitical agendas directly on the back of mass media coverage and by extracting political capital out of an emotional and traumatic situation certainly mainstream media outlets like cnn gain immediate benefit as tv viewers are tuned in incessantly for updates on any breaking situation which translates into high rating and massive advertising income streams for the broadcast networksomething else to consider this shooting event took place the very same week during a major push to pass the republican party healthcare billwhile this very well could not be an act of workplace violence it is still important to ask questions where there are few
